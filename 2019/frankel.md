Ever wanted to try using Clojure? Never got the time? This is an
occasion!

Coming from a mainstream language programming background (Java),
learning a language like Clojure is like hitting your head on the
wall... repeatedly.

After a time, however, pieces seem to fall into place, and the magic
happens: I started to reason in terms of data processing, and not in
terms of objects anymore. If you want to come with me on my journey of
learning Clojure as an OOP guy, I'll be happy to show you strange
beasts such as Dynamic Dispatch, Threading, Contract-Based
Programming, and much much more.
