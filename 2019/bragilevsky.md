#### How types help us solve real-world problems

The Haskell type system is good for specifying user intentions and
helping the compiler to check code correctness. Unfortunately, there
is sometimes a barrier before that level where beginning Haskell
programmer can read and write complex type annotations. This is often
the case with such libraries as Lens or Servant. With this tutorial, I
aim to bring participants behind that barrier. I'll present several
type-level programming tools including type families, GADTs, data
kinds, and others all way down to 'almost' dependent types. Their
description will be given together with practical examples as used in
the modern Haskell libraries.
