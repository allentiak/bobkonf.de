By now EventSourcing is an established alternative to handle and store
data in the backend. But did you realize that frontend architecture
patterns like Flux/Redux basically also work in an event-sourced way?
Unfortunately, in these patterns the event store is inaccessible,
though. With some simple tricks we can make use of it and establish
proper EventSourcing in the frontend as well. Moreover, these events
can also be used to synchronize changes in frontend and backend
without the need to divert from the EventSourcing pattern.

This talk demonstrates how this technique works in general and how it
was used in a real project.
