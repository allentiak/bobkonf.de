Have you ever wanted to prove non-trivial properties of your programs
automatically? It's actually practical with modern SMT solvers like
Z3! I'll walk you through how we can compile a program to an SMT
formula and how we can use that formula to do bounded
verification—checking assertions in our code statically or comparing a
program against an executable specification. This technique is tricky
in general purpose programming, but works wonders for domain-specific
languages.

### Tikhon Jelvis

I picked up Haskell as my first functional language on a whim, and
it's stuck with me ever since. I've worked with other functional
languages too—a compiler in Racket, a backend service in OCaml—but now
I'm back in the Haskell world, working on Target's supply chain
optimization team. Apart from programming in Haskell and giving talks,
I also actively write about Haskell and programming on Quora and help
organize local meetups and events like BayHac.
