### [Gabriele Keller](https://www.uu.nl/staff/GKKeller) 

Since writing her first functional program, an Emacs mode in Elisp, as
a first year student, Gabriele has been fascinated by the concept of
functional programming. Moving on to strongly typed languages like
Haskell, she did her PhD on parallel functional programming. Since
then, she has been active in the Haskell research community and has
contributed to a number of Haskell high-performance libraries. She taught
rogramming language theory and practice at the University
of New South Wales, Sydney since early 2000, and is now a professor at
Utrecht University.
