### [Gabriele Keller](https://www.uu.nl/staff/GKKeller) 

Gabriele Keller has recently been appointed as chair of the 
[Software Technology Group](https://www.uu.nl/staff/organizationalchart/BETA/87/849/858)
at Utrecht University. Before moving to the
Netherlands, she co-founded the Programming Languages & Systems Group
at the University of New South Wales, and was a Principal Researcher
at Data6 (formerly NICTA) in the Trustworthy Systems project. She
contributed to the design of type families in Haskell, and is one of
the co-authors of the paper
[Associated Type Synonyms](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2005/01/at-syns.pdf), which won the
ACM SIGPLAN Most Influential ICFP Paper Award. She co-developed
leading Haskel high-performance array frameworks, including
[Repa](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/repa) and
[Accelerate](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/accelerate). Her research interest are type systems, functional
languages, and how these languages can be used to reduce the costs of
software development, in particular in the context of high-performance
computing and safety critical systems.
