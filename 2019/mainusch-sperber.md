We model the real world, we program behaviour, we build intelligent
machines, we are creators of universes. Coders are mostly antisocial
nerds. However, if you're a non-nerd involved in a software project,
you will need to deal with the code produced by the nerds, even if
it's as incomprehensible as their pick-up lines. Those
incomprehensible programs, and the resulting mismatch between our
minds, the world, and the code - are a key vulnerability of our
universe. (And, if we continue to flood the real universe with IoT
devices, that universe, too.) To address this vulnerability, people
need to communicate - coders and non-coders, both about the code and
through the code. We need code that is welcoming, empathic, charming,
and beautiful. Software craftsmanship, functional programming, and
domain-driven design all can help, but by themselves they are not
enough.  Mainusch and Sperber are cretins of communication: They can't
even decide which of them is the nerd. Sperber talks monads, Mainusch
unsuccessfully waits for them to click. Mainusch talks ideas, Sperber
puts code on slides. But in this talk, they will connect - and if they
can connect, so can the people in your project. We walk a software
lifecycle from back to front, giving examples for communication
beauties and beasts alike, show how to overcome the inevitable
communication breakdowns and find inspiration and beauty in your
project.
