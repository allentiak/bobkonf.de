Purely relational SQL has been abandoned in 1999. Since then, SQL has
got many non-relational features for problems that are hard to solve
with relational algebra. Today, SQL is Turing complete, can process
graphs, has semantic understanding of XML and JSON, is able to
automatically keep historic versions, can analyze time series using
regular expressions and much more.

This presentation demonstrates what modern SQL can do for you. It
compares two different approaches to common problems: a purely
relational one and the modern SQL approach. You will see that modern
SQL databases are the Swiss Army Knives of persistence which allow up
to react quickly when requirements change.

In this session, developers and software architects of all levels gain
a better understanding where SQL is today so that they are able to
make more educated decisions. A lot has happened since SQL-92!
