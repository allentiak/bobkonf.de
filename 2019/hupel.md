Prolog is one of the most underrated programming languages around;
possibly because of its strange syntax and the unusual paradigm. But
it is a very nice special-purpose programming language. In this talk,
I would like to introduce Prologâ€™s programming model, showcase some
programming domains in which Prolog allows for very concise, elegant
programs, and finally describe how it can also be used as a
general-purpose tool.
