Functional programming helps you reason about and test your code by
breaking it into self contained pieces in pure functions. In this
workshop you will be given a code kata and a set of constraints which
train pair programming and functional thinking such as ping pong,
navigator-driver, verbs instead of nouns. Each pair will pick up a
language which supports functional programming and a constraint based
on their self evaluated experience level. The idea is to use
constraints to trigger creative problem solving. Please bring your
laptop which should be ready for development, with everything you need
installed i.e. IDE and unit testing framework. Make sure it is set up
properly by having a new project with a failing test.
