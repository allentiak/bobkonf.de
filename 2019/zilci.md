Functional programming helps you reason about and test your code by
breaking it into self contained pieces in pure functions. In this
workshop you will be given a code kata and a set of constraints which
train pair programming and functional thinking such as ping pong,
navigator-driver, verbs instead of nouns. Each pair will pick up a
language which supports functional programming and a constraint based
on their self evaluated experience level. The idea is to use
constraints to trigger creative problem solving.  You can consider this a mini
version of a coderetreat, and read more about it
[here](https://www.coderetreat.org/).
