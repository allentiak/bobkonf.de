#### My Experience Building Node.js Applications with Typescript

TypeScript is an optionally typed superset of JavaScript that compiles
to plain JavaScript. Because of the benefits of using Typescript, we
have seen several companies including Slack, BlazeMeter, AppDynamics
and Hashnode make the transition from Javascript. Weâ€™ll explore these
advantages of using Typescript which include:

- According to a [recent study](https://blog.acolyer.org/2017/09/19/to-type-or-not-to-type-quantifying-detectable-bugs-in-javascript/), 15% of bugs won't make it to production if types were employed in Javascript applications.
- When dealing with large codebase, types can serve as documentation and makes it easier for newer developers to get started quickly.
- Typescript allows you work with newer Javascript version syntax, without having you worried about whether they will work across older Javascript processors.
- It makes it easier for you to detect errors quickly and make smooth changes while you refactor your code.
- The community adoption and support is huge, compared to alternative type systems for Javascript. That makes it very easy to find solutions to problems you might be facing as you adopt Typescript.
- The editor support is great, so you have features like autocomplete which speed up your development.
- Migration to and from Javascript is super easy, since it is a superset of Javascript.
