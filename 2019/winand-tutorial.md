#### An Epidemic Plague 

What if a single root cause was responsible for most SQL performance issues?

Proper indexing is a very time and cost-effective way to improve SQL
performance. Yet hardly anyone gets it right so that about 50% of all
SQL performance problems can be attributed to the index/query
mismatch.

In this tutorial I’ll explain how organisational structures hinder
proper indexing and why it is not sufficiently covered in the relevant
literature. Naturally, this tutorial will also explain how to approach
indexing for a better result and demonstrate the most common indexing
mistakes in a fun and educating way: in a live quiz with the audience.

Markus Winand is an independent author, trainer and consultant on all
things SQL. His book *SQL Performance Explained* has just been
translated into a fifth language. It can be purchased as a print
edition, and it’s also available [for free on his
website](http://use-the-index-luke.com/). Markus is currently working on his
second book centered on the idea that things have changed a lot since
SQL-92. It is likewise available [free of charge online](http://modern-sql.com).
