At this year's WWDC, Apple announced Swift: a new language for iOS and
OS X development. Swift is very different from Objective C, the
language currently used for development on these platforms. In
particular, Swift has several language features, such as algebraic
data types, pattern matching, higher-order functions, and generics,
that make it suitable for functional programming.

### Preparations

Participants will work in pairs; every pair should have a Mac with
[Xcode 6.1](https://itunes.apple.com/en/app/xcode/id497799835?mt=12)
installed.

### Wouter Swierstra

Wouter Swierstra is a lecturer at the University of Utrecht's Software
Technology Group. He has been working with functional languages for
the past fifteen years, both in industry and academia. Most recently,
he has been been writing a book together with Chris Eidhof and Florian
Kugler about functional programming in Swift.

### Chris Eidhof

Chris is a Dutch software developer living in Berlin (Germany). He
spends most of his time building iOS and Mac apps, such as [Deckset](
http://decksetapp.com). He started [UIKonf](http://www.uikonf.com),
[objc.io ](http://www.objc.io), and wrote a book about [Functional
Programming in Swift](http://www.objc.io/books/).

### Florian Kugler

Florian is a software developer from Berlin. He’s currently working on
[Deckset](http://decksetapp.com/) and on other
projects on the iOS and Mac platforms. He’s also one of the
co-founders of [objc.io](http://www.objc.io <http://www.objc.io/>), a
monthly online magazine for iOS and OS X developers, and a co-author
of a book about [Functional Programming in
Swift](http://www.objc.io/books <http://www.objc.io/books>).
