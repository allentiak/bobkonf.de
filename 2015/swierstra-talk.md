At this year's WWDC, Apple announced Swift: a new language for iOS and
OS X development. Swift is very different from Objective C, the
language currently used for development on these platforms. In
particular, Swift has several language features, such as algebraic
data types, pattern matching, higher-order functions, and generics,
that make it suitable for functional programming. In this talk, I will
give a brief overview of some of Swift's functional features and these
features can be effectively employed in everyday programming.
