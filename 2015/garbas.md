Allow me to introduce you to Nix - The Purely Functional Package Manager.

Nix is a powerful package manager for Linux and other Unix systems that makes
package management reliable and reproducible. It provides atomic upgrades and
rollbacks, side-by-side installation of multiple versions of a package,
multi-user package management and easy setup of build environments.

We will also look into NixOS - The Purely Functional Linux Distribution.

NixOS is a Linux distribution with a unique approach to package and
configuration management. Built on top of the Nix package manager, it is
completely declarative, makes upgrading systems reliable.
