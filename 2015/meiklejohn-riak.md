Riak is a highly-available, fault-tolerant, distributed
Dynamo-inspired key-value store.  Riak's primary focus is never losing
writes; whether this be sorting multiple values under concurrent
operations to the same key, or accepting writes in event of a network
partition.  During this session we will provide a brief tutorial on
how Riak works, and then explore the various APIs of which Riak
provides for building applications on top of.
