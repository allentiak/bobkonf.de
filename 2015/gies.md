This tutorial will have two parts, the first part will give some
theoretical background, an introduction to the architecture of cloud
management systems (Project FiFo), a quick look into each component,
what they do, how they communicate, and the tradeoffs chosen.

In the second part we'll build a small "cloudâ€™" - we'll walk through a
setup of Project FiFo to the point where every participant has a
running installation on their system. If time permits and interest
exists we then can join those to create a larger incarnation of the
system and experiment with some failover characteristics by brutally
murdering parts of it.

Attendees should bring:

- a moderately powerful laptop with at least 8GB of memory (to spare 4 for the virtual machine) 
- a virtualization software such as [VMWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
