This tutorial will have two parts. The first part will give some
theoretical background, an introduction to the architecture of cloud
management systems (Project FiFo), a quick look into each component,
what they do, how they communicate, and the tradeoffs chosen.

In the second part we’ll build a small “cloud”. We’ll walk through a
setup of Project FiFo until every participant has a running
installation on their system. If time permits, we can join those to
create a larger system and experiment with failover characteristics by
disabling and destroying components.

### Attendees should bring:

- A moderately powerful laptop with at least 8GB of memory (to spare 4 for the virtual machine)
- Virtualization software such as as [VMWare Player](http://www.vmware.com/products/player) or [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
