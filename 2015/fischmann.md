Haskell is an elegant and fascinating language that has made purely
functional programming practical. This tutorial aims at giving you a
sense of direction in the Haskell eco system. We will explain and
motivate key language concepts and introduce tools and development
techniques as we need them for our examples.

We will start by exploring basic syntax and the Haskell type system in
an interactive Haskell environment. The need to write (slightly)
larger programs will naturally lead us to the Haskell module
system. We will show how to use cabal and the hackage library database
to install packages and create our own.

Key language concepts are hard to pick and will depend on the
interests of the audience. Some candidates are algebraic data types
and pattern matching, polymorphic functions, type classes, monads, GHC
language extensions, or programming with typed holes.

Prerequisites: You should install the [Haskell
Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) on your laptop.
Knowledge of Haskell is not required, but a certain aptitude in at
least one other programming language will be helpful.

Presentation language will be English, but we are happy to discuss
your questions in German.

#### Matthias Fischmann

Matthias Fischmann has implemented his thesis at the Max Planck
Institute for Computer Science in Haskell 15 years ago, and has been a
user and proponent of functional programming ever since.  He works as
a software consultant for well-typed.com and is CEO at zerobuzz.net.

#### Alexander Ulrich

Alexander Ulrich learned to love functional programming in OCaml and
Haskell during his studies in computer science.  He works as a
research assistant at TÃ¼bingen University on translation methods for
database queries and integrating database queries in functional
programming languages.
