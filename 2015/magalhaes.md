Advanced functional programming is commonplace in academia. In this
talk I will explain why it is time to bring its advantages to industry
too. Through my experience with Chordify, a web start-up that brings
chord recognition to the masses, I have explored the benefits of
exposing open-source, cutting-edge research to a wider audience. I
will share several insights gained from my experience, namely with
regards to: the architecture of a functional backend, interaction
between this backend and a PHP/JS frontend, handling millions of
visits per month with minimal hassle, and the logistics of an internet
start-up.

#### José Pedro Magalhães

After completing his PhD at Utrecht University, José Pedro Magalhães
has pursued both an academic career at the University of Oxford, and
an entrepreneurial path, as a co-founder and developer at Chordify, an
internet start-up that attracts over a million visitors each month.
He has previously worked as an intern in industrial research
environments at CERN (Geneva), Philips Research (Eindhoven), and
Microsoft Research (Cambridge).  Over the past decade, he has
co-authored dozens of scientific publications, contributed to numerous
Haskell libraries, and implemented his research ideas in the most
important Haskell compiler (GHC).
