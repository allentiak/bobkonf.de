Webmachine is a system for easily and declaratively building
well-behaved HTTP applications. It is based on a very different
execution model than most web frameworks such as Rails and Sinatra.
It models web resources as collections of functions representing each
part of the HTTP decision tree.  This approach makes it easy to focus
on writing the core of your application and also helps you to get the
harder parts of HTTP right.

This workshop will guide the attendee through understanding and
getting started with Webmachine, gradually exposing richer HTTP
features while building out an application that is used by browsers
and API clients alike. Knowledge of Erlang is not necessary for this
workshop, but experience with a functional language is recommended.

### Preparations

For the tutorial, you should have a C compiler, and Erlang R16B02.

Here are detailed instructions:

Note: This is the same preparation as for the [Riak
tutorial](meiklejohn-riak.html), and is also sufficient preparation
for the [Erlang tutorial](rehfeld.html).
