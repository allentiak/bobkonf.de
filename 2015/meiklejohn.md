Webmachine is a system for easily and declaratively building
well-behaved HTTP applications. It is based on a very different
execution model than most frameworks, with sets of resources defined
by collections of functional predicates over those resources. This
approach makes it easy to focus on writing the core of your
application and also helps you to get the harder parts of HTTP right.
This workshop will guide the attendee through understanding and
getting started with Webmachine, gradually exposing richer HTTP
features while building out an application that is used by browsers
and API clients alike.
