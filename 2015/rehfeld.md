Erlang is famous for long-running interruption-free installations and
is often the tool of choice when it comes to distributed systems with
massive concurrency.

To get an understanding of why Erlang works very well for these kind
of problems, we need to look not only at the Erlang language, but
also the Erlang virtual machine (BEAM) with its underlying process,
messaging and memory management model.

By the end of this session, you should have a good impression about
Erlang's inner workings and we will dispel some myths along the way.

Presentation language will be English, but I am happy to discuss your
questions in German.

### Preparations

1. Install Erlang for your Platform from [`https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp`](https://www.erlang-solutions.com/downloads/download-erlang-otp).
   Any Release after and including R16B02 will work just fine for our
   purposes.
   
   *Note*: If you're attending the [Webmachine
   tutorial](meiklejohn.html) or the [Riak
   tutorial](meiklejohn-riak.html), follow the instructions there and
   install Erlang 16B02 instead of a later version.

2. Clone the workspace from [`https://github.com/martinrehfeld/bob-erlang-2014`](https://github.com/martinrehfeld/bob-erlang-2014), e.g.
   `git clone https://github.com/martinrehfeld/bob-erlang-2014.git`

### Martin Rehfeld

Martin is a fan of Functional Programming and has been using Erlang
as his main workhorse for the last couple of years at Wooga.
