			<h1>Policies</h1>
			
			<h4>Diversity Policy</h4>
			<p>
			We welcome you.
			</p><p>
			We try to be inclusive, welcoming, and supportive of anyone who comes
			to us with good faith.
			</p><p>
			We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race,
			ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level,
			neurotype, religion, age, elder status, family structure, culture,
			subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification. We
			welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, dilettantes,
			musicians, photographers, readers, writers, ordinary people,
			extraordinary people, and everyone in between. You may wear a baby
			sling, hijab, a kippah, leather, piercings, a pentacle, a political
			badge, a rainbow, a rosary, tattoos, or something we can only dream
			of. You may carry a guitar or knitting needles or a sketchbook. You
			may be conservative or liberal, libertarian or socialist or have
			political opinions outside these categories.
			</p><p>
			We will know and protect your rights when it comes to free expression
			and privacy. We also have enough experience to know that we won't get
			it perfect on the first try. But we have enough hope, energy, and
			idealism to want to learn things we don't know now. We may not be able
			to satisfy everyone, but we can certainly work to avoid offending
			anyone. And we promise that if we get it wrong, we'll listen carefully
			and respectfully to you when you point it out to us, and weâ€™ll do our
			best to make good on our mistakes.
			</p>

			<h4>Anti Harassment Policy</h4>
			<p>
			We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
			for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
			in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
			conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating
			these rules may be expelled from the conference without a refund at
			the discretion of the conference organizers.
			</p><p>
			Any form of written, social media, or verbal communication that can be
			offensive or harassing to any attendee, speaker or staff is not
			allowed at BOB. Please inform a staff member if you feel a violation
			has taken place and the conference leadership team will address the
			situation.
			</p><p>
			Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
			sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
			religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation;
			stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained
			disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact;
			and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any
			harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
			</p><p>
			Exhibitors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
			particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
			or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
			sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
			sexualized environment.
			</p><p>
			If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
			or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
			staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts
			and/or special badges.
