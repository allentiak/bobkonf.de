Testing business logic quickly becomes tricky, as applications grow
and scale. Example based unit and integration tests, and exploratory
tests become poor choices to check and verify a large state
space. Also such methods are not well-suited to clearly describe the
state space / transitions we want to test.

Since we use Clojure to write test suites and tools at Helpshift, we
tried experimenting with DSLs to express some of our testing
problems. We've found that mini DSLs can indeed become useful to
describe and test fairly complicated business logic.

In this talk I will cover some of the mini-DSL approaches we've tried,
demonstrate one of them by example, and discuss the benefits and
drawbacks based on current experience.

### Mayank Jain

Mayank Jain is a Dev/QA Engineer at Helpshift. He enjoys controlling
difficult testing problems with the power of Clojure.

When not writing tests, DSLs, or state machines at work, he likes
exploring functional programming. Currently fascinated by APL and
Factor.

Also, Maynk is a huge comics fan and lifelong Calvin and Hobbes devotee.
