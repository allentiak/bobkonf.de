Haskell is an elegant and fascinating language that has made purely
functional programming practical. This tutorial aims at giving you a
sense of direction in the Haskell eco system. We will explain and
motivate key language concepts and introduce tools and development
techniques as we need them for our examples.

Key language concepts are hard to pick and will depend on the
interests of the audience. Some candidates are algebraic data types
and pattern matching, polymorphic functions, type classes, monads, GHC
language extensions, or programming with typed holes.

Presentation language will be English, but we are happy to discuss
your questions in German.

### Preparations

Prerequisites: You will need to run the commands `ghci` and `stack` in
the tutorial.  The recommended way of getting them is the 
[Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/).
Knowledge of Haskell is not required, but a certain aptitude in at
least one other programming language will be helpful.

### Matthias Fischmann

Matthias Fischmann has implemented his thesis at the Max Planck
Institute for Computer Science in Haskell 15 years ago, and has been a
user and proponent of functional programming ever since.  He works as
a software consultant for well-typed.com and is CEO at zerobuzz.net.
