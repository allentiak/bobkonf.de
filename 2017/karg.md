PureScript is a language for functional programming in the browser designed
for low adoption barriers. It looks very much like somebody took static
types and explicit effects out of Haskell and imposed them on javascript.
And in fact, this is how Purescript was born.

In the short 90 minutes we have, I will cover the basics of PureScript for
those who are not familiar with functional programming, and then walk you
through a small web app with purescript-halogen, a UI library that adheres
to the Functional Reactive Programming (FRP) design. I hope to have time to
demonstrate how purescript comfortably integrates with any existing
JavaScript context, which makes it a great tool for incremental adoption.

### Prerequisites

If you want to code along, you should set up the development
environment and get the hello-world app running prior to your
participation in the tutorial. I will have instructions on that up by
Feb'17 in the following github
repository:
[`https://github.com/mgmeier/purescript-tutorial-bob2017`](https://github.com/mgmeier/purescript-tutorial-bob2017).

Knowledge of PureScript is not required, but a certain aptitude in at least
one other programming language will be helpful. Some knowledge of the
JavaScript world will help you getting the code to run in the browser
somewhat more smoothly.

Presentation language will be English, but I am happy to discuss your
questions in German.  This is joint work with Matthias Fischmann.

### Michael Karg

During the studies for his master’s degree in computer science and general
linguistics at Göttingen University (Germany), Michael came in contact with
lambda calculus and the Haskell programming language. He kept on using it
professionally and privately ever since graduation.

His fascination with functional programming (and type systems) lies not
only in how directly the theoretical, academic discourse about it can be
applied to every-day code, but also in how reliably it improves software
quality in several regards. For two years now he has been working on
building production-grade software for the web in Haskell and PureScript
 at Symbolian GmbH.
