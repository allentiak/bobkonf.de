Encapsulation is a pillar of object-oriented programming, but how
important is it in the context of functional programming? Is it worth
clinging to, or should we stay away? This talk will examine the
tradeoffs of encapsulating internal representations versus exposing
the "nature" of our data.

Programming with immutable values and algebraic data types usually
makes hiding fields behind accessors unnecessary. On the other hand,
hiding functions and types is a crucial technique control our API,
encouraging correct usage and affording the flexibility to change it.

In this session we will explore constraints that encourage
encapsulation, discuss how it affects our types, their algebras, and
their algorithmic properties, and learn about alternatives and their
benefits and drawbacks.
