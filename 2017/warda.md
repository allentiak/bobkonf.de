From graph theory through the history of computing and how it affected
database design, to why relational databases aren't about relations.
Next, a look at how diverse the current graph database market is and what
obvious and not so obvious problems are solved by graphs. We will see how
to launder money, suggest products, give answers to NLP tasks, build a
knowledge base, balance a game economy and model mixed concept domains. A
short introduction to Neo4j's query language, Cypher, will show the main
concepts of querying graph data. Then, by use of the same datasets in both
relational and graph databases will compare syntactic clarity and database
performance.
