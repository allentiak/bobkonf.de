27 years ago I
published
[Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.pdf),
a manifesto for FP--but the subject is much older than that! In this
talk I'll take a deep dive into history to revisit a personal
selection of highlights, ranging from Church encodings through
functional geometry to QuickCheck on a chip.

### John Hughes

[John Hughes](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/)
has been a functional programming enthusiast for more than thirty
years, at the Universities of Oxford, Glasgow, and since 1992 Chalmers
University in Gothenburg, Sweden. He served on the Haskell design
committee, co-chairing the committee for Haskell 98, and is the author
of more than 75 papers,
including
[Why Functional Programming Matters](http://www.cse.chalmers.se/~rjmh/Papers/whyfp.pdf),
one of the classics of the area. With Koen Claessen, he created
[QuickCheck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/QuickCheck), the most popular testing tool among Haskell programmers,
and in 2006 he founded [Quviq](http://www.quviq.com/) to commercialise
the technology using Erlang.
