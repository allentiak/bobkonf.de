Package management seems to quickly become a thing of the past as
developers and distributions increasingly accept bundling and binary
imaging as a solution to the problems caused by traditional packaging
and deployment efforts.  We claim that the level of packages is still
the most appropriate level of abstraction and demonstrate how functional
package management fixes the defects of traditional package management.
We introduce GNU Guix as an implementation of a functional package
manager and showcase features that are especially useful for developing
software and for maintaining heterogeneous software environments.

The effects of expressing packages in a DSL embedded in the general
purpose language GNU Guile (one of the key differences to Nix) will be
demonstrated by interacting with packages on the REPL and showing
tools that use Guix as a Scheme library.

### Ricardo Wurmus

Ricardo is a free software hacker and GNU/Linux system administrator.
He's currently working to support the high performance computing
platform at the Max-Delbrueck-Centrum where he develops and packages
scientific software using the functional package manager GNU Guix.  As
a core contributor and co-maintainer of GNU Guix he has extensive
experience in making stubborn software work.
