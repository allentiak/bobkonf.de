#### IoT Analytics Platform on Top of SMACK

Nowadays analyzing vast amount of sensor data in real-time for process
optimization and event prediction has become a major task for a
production line. Major questions focus on how to build a system to
process multiple gigabyte data per second on various locations.  In
this presentation we focus at a BigData analytics platform which is
built on top of the SMACK stack, it is an acronym for Spark, Mesos,
Akka, Cassandra and Kafka. SMACK provides an ecosystem for handling
high frequent low-level events and for the creation of high-level
events to trigger business processes as a reaction to derived
knowledge in a bimodal IoT architecture. To go into detail, we break
down to a stream based approach, SMACK components and interaction
between them. The central parts of the system (Spark Streams, Akka
Streams, Akka Actors) will be revealed on concrete code snippets in
Scala. Learning outcomes for attendees: better understanding of SMACK,
benefits of a pure functional approach for building scalable
platforms, experiences and best practices for working with SMACK,
assets of bimodal architecture for combining IoT and BPM.
