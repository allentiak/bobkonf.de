Blockchain technology like Bitcoin popularised the concept of decentralised
consensus. Together with the rise of peer-to-peer technologies, it becomes
possible to entirely decouple data-ownership from its physical storage and
reorganise information in a privacy-sensitive manner. SAFE is a
decentralised communication and storage network with a
local-group-consensus mechanism to ensure consistency. But without central
servers how do you organise user-generated content â€“ like comments on a
blog?

In this talk, we will explore the privacy-first data structures employed on
SAFE, how you can use cryptography to provide access control on the data
layer directly and thus rethink the idea of "central storage in the cloud".
Finally, we will take a short look into the important role functional
programming will play in these networks in the future
