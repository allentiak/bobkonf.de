<h1>Speaker Grants</h1>
<p>
BOB is pleased to announce our first round of Speaker Grants to
support speakers from groups under-represented in technology.  We
specifically seek women speakers and speakers who would not be able to
attend the conference for financial reasons.  The goal is to make BOB
a more diverse, useful and enjoyable event.
</p>
<h4>Eligibility</h4>
<p>
Speaker Grants are available for all speakers accepted at
BOB 2017 from under-represented groups in technology.
</p>
<h4>Selection</h4>
<p>
Applications will be reviewed by a committee consisting of
Michael Sperber, Active Group, and Stefan Wehr, factis Research, and
will be accepted based upon need and impact. All information will be
kept confidential by the committee.
