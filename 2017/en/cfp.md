## [BOB 2017](/2017/) - Berlin, February 24, 2017

# Call for Contributions

You are actively engaged in advanced software engineering methods, implement ambitious
architectures and are open to cutting-edge innovation? Attend this
conference, meet people that share your goals, and get to know the
best software tools and technologies available today. We strive to
offer a day full of new experiences and impressions that you can
use to immediately improve your daily life as a software developer.

If you share our vision and want to contribute, submit a proposal for a talk or tutorial!

### Topics

We are looking for talks about best-of-breed software technology,
e.g.:

* functional programming
* persistent data structures and databases
* types
* formal methods for correctness and robustness
* abstractions for concurrency and parallelism
* metaprogramming
* probabilistic programming
* …  everything really that isn’t mainstream, but you think should be.

Presenters should provide the audience with information that is
practically useful for software developers.  

This time, we're especially interested in *experience reports*.  But
this could also take other forms, e.g.:

* introductory talks on technical background
* overviews of a given field
* demos and how-tos

### Requirements

We accept proposals for presentations of 45 minutes (40 minutes talk +
5 minutes questions), as well as 90 minute tutorials for beginners.
The language of presentation should be either English or German. 

[Your proposal](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFuyBhBTCOTS0zTXBzY1KVuKpumyIBTucLcJ1ArC1XpWsG-Q/viewform)
should include (in your presentation language of choice):

* an abstract of max. 1500 characters.
* a short bio/cv
* contact information (including at least email address)
* a list of 3-5 concrete ideas of how your work can be applied in a developer's daily life
* additional material (websites, blogs, slides, videos of past
  presentations, …)
