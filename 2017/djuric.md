Have you ever seen hierarchical probabilistic models computed in
milliseconds? Now it is possible, on a low-cost desktop machine, from
a dynamic and interactive REPL environment in Clojure. This talk
presents Bayadera, an opinionated Bayesian statistical library backed
by a high-speed massively parallel MCMC engine that runs on the
GPU. Bayadera has been designed with programmers in mind; it is
optimized not only for dynamic, interactive model-building and
experimentation, but also to provide fast performance in
production. There is even more; Bayadera has been written in Clojure,
which is a pragmatic modern Lisp dialect that runs on Java Virtual
Machine, and plays well with the Java ecosystem. The talk will
introduce interactive development in Clojure, an infrastructure for
high-performance numerical computing provided by Uncomplicate
libraries, and give a walk-through of real model building and fitting
from one of the later chapters of
the
[Doing Bayesian Data Analysis](https://sites.google.com/site/doingbayesiandataanalysis/).

### Dragan Djuric

Dragan Djuric is a professor at the Department of Software
Engineering, FON, University of Belgrade, Serbia. He passionately uses
Clojure as a primary language since 2009, and teaches Clojure-based
courses at the university since 2010. He published his Clojure-based
research in leading scientific journals, but does not skip
contributiong to the community through open-source Clojure projects
(www.uncomplicate.org). His main interests are in the area of software
engineering and intelligent systems, but programming in Clojure is the
activity he enjoys the most. When he is not working in Emacs, he likes
doing his daily dose of long-distance running, gym, and Cuban salsa
dancing. He also has a black belt in Taekwondo, but is a very calm and
friendly person :)
