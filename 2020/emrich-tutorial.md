<i>Static type systems</i> have arrived in the frontend! <i>Typescript</i>
and <i>Flow</i> made them popular. <b>ReasonML</b> - the language by
<b>React Framework</b> inventor <i>Jordan Walke</i> - goes one step further
and brings a functional programming language from the ML family into the
browser. ReasonML combines the semantics of <i>OCaml</i> with the
common syntax of <i>JavaScript</i>.

With the language comes a redefinition of the popular React-Framework:
<b>ReasonReact</b>. ReasonReact finally realizes the original vision, its
creator had for React - a fully functional driven frontend framework! The
framework comes already equipped with <i>hooks</i> and <i>reducers</i>. It
also provides a type safe way to build components in a JSX-like syntax -
without the need to overspecify, thanks to Reason's excellent type
inference.

You will learn how to write Reason & ReasonReact code, which projects are
worth using it and even when you should rather prefer alternatives like
TypeScript or Elm.

In this workshop we will

 * take a look at the concepts of the ReasonML-language
 * model data with the algebraic type system
 * build a simple frontend application in ReasonReact
 * write unit-tests with bs-jest
