Referential transparency is a property that lets us better understand
computer programs, because it allows us to safely replace expressions
with their values without changing the programs behavior in other
places. To achieve referential transparency, we have to program using
pure functions and function composition as primary tools.

Seen abstractly, the process of composing and decomposing of pure
functions closely relate to the essential principle of problem: "To
solve a large problem, split it up into subproblems and solve these
recursively, then combine the solutions." What implications does this
correlation have on functional programs?

In this talk, I argue why function composition is the essence of
programming, and how it manifests itself through some abstractions we
know from the functional world.

Ludvig is a consultant with INNOQ in Cologne, Germany. Ever since
he was introduced to functional programming at university, his main
interest has been exploring ideas from the functional world, both in
theory and in practice. Ludvig enjoys programming in and talking about
languages like Haskell, Clojure, Scala, and Erlang.
