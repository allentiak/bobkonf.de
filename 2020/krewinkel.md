Haskell is part of the open source ecosystem and is here to stay. We
use [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/), the swiss army knive of document
conversion, which created in 2006 by John MacFarlane, to dive into the
effects of using Haskell in an open source project.  Pandoc enjoys
widespread use among technical and less-technical users and is one of
the best known open source Haskell programs with millions of
downloads. Yet, even programmers interested in functional programming
are frequently unaware of pandoc's implementation language.

We use pandoc as an example to answer many real-life questions which
surround Haskell: How did the choice of programming language effect
the development of the project? Do developers get scared away by a
language with a reputation of being difficult to learn? Is anyone but
computer scientists and mathematicians able to contribute in a
meaningful way? The answers will help decision makers to know the pros
and cons of using Haskell for their applications.

Albert is a molecular biologist turned mathematician turned software
developer. He looks at close to a decade of industry experience and
serves a pandoc core developer with a special interest in pandoc's Lua
subsystem. No matter the programming language, he always tries to make
code safer through proper application of types. After spending time in
LÃ¼beck, Hamburg, and Menlo Park, Albert now lives in Berlin with his
wife and kids.
