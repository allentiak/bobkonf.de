So you know how to write code. You know how to work as an
individual. But... how about as a team? When a team works well
together, they can best fulfil the business function, while meeting
personal emotional needs.

In the past few years, at five companies, Iâ€™ve experienced a lot of
different ways of working. Finally, at Previse, I was part of a team that
solved problems together effectively. Sounds simple, but it had taken them
a combined 80+ years of expertise to get there!

The engineering team at Previse identified a methodology that guided their
collaboration. Every day they engaged in the process of evolving it and
embodying continuous learning.

This talk is about better ways of working together. It's worth
accounting for how you're just a bunch of emotional mortals. Identify
your team's unique characteristics, and get everyone on board.

### Steve Robinson-Burns

Steve gathered the material for this talk at Previse, a fintech
startup, where he worked as a a Software
Engineer. They use Clojure, which is a great problem solving tool, but
he believes that as tools go, teamwork is even better. He's also a big
fan of deleting code. Based in Edinburgh, he enjoys long walks with
his dog Snug and growing his own vegetables.
