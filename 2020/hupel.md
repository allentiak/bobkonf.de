In the old times, way back, Java used to be the only JVM
language. Later on, a few other players entered the field, such as
Jython and JRuby. But those were just for scripting, right? It didn't
take long for compiled languages to catch up. With Scala and Kotlin,
we have definitely entered the age of polyglot programming on the
JVM. The Truffle project – part of GraalVM – is a promising approach
to make it easy, efficient, and seamless to run alternative languages
on the same VM as Java. This talk will look at the new age of polyglot
programming and all the cool things we can do with it.
