Concurrent and distributed programs are notoriously difficult to get
right.  Even tiny variations of algorithms like Peterson’s lock for
mutual exclusion lead to significantly different behaviours and errors
that are complex to locate.

TLA+ is a high-level language for modelling such programs and
specifying their behaviour in a rigorous way.  In this tutorial, you
will learn how to write concurrent and distributed algorithms in
PlusCal, a pseudo-code like interface for TLA+, and how to specify
correctness conditions using temporal logic.  We will further apply
the model-checker TLC and discuss typical pitfalls when working with
TLA+.

### Preparation

Please install the TLA Toolbox on your machine by following the
instructions on [this page](https://lamport.azurewebsites.net/tla/toolbox.html).

Annette is a lecturer and senior researcher at the TU
Kaiserslautern. Her research interests are the semantics of concurrent
and distributed programming, with a focus on replication and
synchronization, and how they are reflected on a programming language
level. Annette was involved in several national and international
research projects, most recently in the EU-Projects “SyncFree:
Large-scale Computation without Synchronization” and “Lightkone:
Lightweight computation for networks at the edge“. She is further
leading the development of AntidoteDB, a transactional CRDT-key value
store.
