BOB is the conference for developers, architects and decision-makers
to explore technologies beyond the mainstream in software development,
and to find the best tools available to software developers today. Our
goal is for all participants of BOB to return home with new insights
that enable them to improve their own software development
experiences.

The program features 14 talks and 8 tutorials on current topics:

formal methods, architecture documentation, functional-reactive
programming, and language design.

The tutorials feature introductions to Idris, Haskell, F#, TLA+,
