What is the cost of changing an api? How can we measure it? JavaScript
is one of the most widely used and run languages in the world. The
committee behind the design of JavaScript, Technical Committee 39 of
Ecma, has to keep in mind many potential use cases, and errors that
might occur as the result of a design change. However we do not have a
framework of how to do this. As a delegate, I felt that this was an
area where the committee could benefit from. This talk will cover the
work that is happening now to introduce such a framework of
experimentation to our process, where we are and what kind of
experiments we are currently running.
