Undoubtedly, the standard format of sharing computations in the
business world is the spreadsheet. But this quickly becomes unwieldy
when complex algorithms are involved or deeply structured data are
more appropriate for the problem at hand. So how to present the inner
workings of an algorithm in such a way that it may be part of an
invoice, to be checked by accountants?  We advertise an idea that is
actually as old as spreadsheets and show how, building on top of some
popular Haskell packages, one can obtain an embedded domain-specific
language for self-documenting computations.
