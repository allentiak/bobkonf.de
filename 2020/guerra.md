Programmers enjoy looking back and learning about the primitive
technologies used "back in the day" like hexadecimal code, assembly,
punched cards, paper teletypes and how complicated things were. We
rarely do the inverse exercise and imagine which technologies will
look primitive from a future perspective.

What if the current state of computing is just a really low local
maxima?  Which technologies will be replaced by obviously superior
ones, which ones will survive the test of time?  What if the computer
revolution hasn't happened yet?  Do we know how to compute?

Someone said that "The future is already here â€“ it's just not evenly
distributed", in this talk we will see if it is in fact here, which tools
are already available to escape the local maxima and if not already here,
which hints of that future are available on current research.
