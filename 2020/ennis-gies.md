In this talk, we confess our rusty sins: memory manipulation, unsafe
code, lying to the borrow tracker, lifetime crimes, and many
more. Criminally fast rust is possible, and we share what worked for
us, what didn’t, and why we broke the safe.

Over the past year we’ve been building Tremor - an event processing
system used at Wayfair to process billions of messages per minute
24x7x365. This is our first project as an organization and as
individuals with the Rust programming language.

We’ve learned a lot: to hate rust, to love it, to hate and love it
again; there are things we did badly, some we did terribly as we bent
to the borrow trackers demands, before bending the borrow tracker to
our needs.
