In this talk we build a web application in Elm that reads some good
old school Nokia 3310 ringtones and plays them in a browser. We will
explore how to write a parser to interpret the Ring Tone Text Transfer
Language (RTTTL) format and how to use modern Web Audio APIs to
recreate those iconic sounds. We will conclude the talk by playing a
selection of tunes, applying some effects and having a good time.

Ju was born in China, moved to Italy as a kid, grew up eating a lot of
pasta, and started messing around with computers. He now lives in
London and works for NoRedInk. He loves to solve interesting problems
and build amazing products. When he’s not doing that, he’s probably
rock climbing.
