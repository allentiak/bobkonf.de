<i>Static type systems</i> have arrived in the frontend! <i>Typescript</i>
and <i>Flow</i> made them popular. <b>ReasonML</b> - the language by
<b>React Framework</b> inventor <i>Jordan Walke</i> - goes one step further
and brings a functional programming language from the ML family into the
browser. ReasonML combines the semantics of <i>OCaml</i> with the
common syntax of <i>JavaScript</i>.

How well does this work in practice? How easily can ReasonML be
integrated into the existing JS ecosystem? How well do SinglePage apps
work with ReasonReact? Where does ReasonML stand in comparison to
TypeScript on one side or Elm on the other?  We tried it in real
projects, and the talk will be about our experience, which projects
are worth using Reason and when you should rather do without it.
