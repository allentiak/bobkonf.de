Heather Miller is a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, in the
School of Computer Science, primarily affiliated with the Institute
for Software Research.  Formerly, she was the co-founder and Executive
Director of the Scala Center at EPFL. She was also an Assistant
Clinical Professor in the College of Computer and Information Science
at Northeastern University.


Some of her projects include programming models and type systems to
facilitate the design of new, functional distributed systems, such as
[distributable closures](https://speakerdeck.com/heathermiller/spores-distributable-functions-in-scala), 
[flexible, extensible, and performant serialization](https://speakerdeck.com/heathermiller/instant-pickles-generating-object-oriented-pickler-combinators-for-fast-and-extensible-serialization), asynchronous and
concurrent programming via [futures and promises](https://speakerdeck.com/heathermiller/futures-and-promises-in-scala-2-dot-10), and
[deterministic concurrent dataflow](https://github.com/heathermiller/scala-dataflow/raw/master/reports/lcpc-pres/lcpc-pres.pdf).
          
She works on and around the [Scala](http://scala-lang.org) programming language.
