According to a recent survey by Github, only 4&nbsp;% of open source
participants & ideators are women and/or non-binary. 

This might be due to the fact that women especially find it
intimidating to get started with contributing to open source. The talk
will answer questions, throwing light on the issues that women usually
have. It aims at introducing the audience to the world of FOSS and
elaborate the vast range of opportunities ranging from coding to
documentation, design, outreach and research.  The talk aspires to
inspire budding girl developers and showcase women whoâ€™ve made
significant contributions to technology.
