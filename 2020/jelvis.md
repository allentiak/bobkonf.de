How can we work with time in functional programming? Traditionally,
reactive systems—UIs, web servers, robotic controllers,
simulations—are seen as inherently imperative, not suitable for
functional programming. This does not have to be the case! Functional
Reactive Programming (FRP), lets us have our cake and eat it too: we
can use the composable, declarative style we love as functional
programmers to write this kind of code. But what <i>is</i> FRP? It's
surprisingly hard to get a clear answer without diving deeply into
research literature. I will give you an introduction with practical
Haskell examples that will get you over the hump to understanding and
using FRP.

Tikhon picked up Haskell as his first functional language on a whim,
and it's stuck with him ever since. He's worked with other functional
languages too – a compiler in Racket, a backend service in
OCaml -- but now he's back in the Haskell world, working on
Target's supply chain optimization team. Apart from programming in
Haskell and giving talks, he also actively writes about Haskell and
programming on Quora and helps organize local meetups and events like
BayHac.
