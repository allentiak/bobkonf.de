In functional programming languages, Algebraic Data Types and Pattern
Matching are ubiquitous, and they are a very powerful and expressive
tool. Unfortunately, many mainstream languages, especially in the
object-oriented spectrum, lack these features and resort to rather
cumbersome subtyping and inheritance.

But not all is lost! Leveraging an old GoF pattern together with
Lambda syntax that by now has spread to most modern programming
languages, we can emulate ADTs and pattern matching in virtually any
programming language.

Applications range from implementation of standard ADTs like `Maybe`,
Tuples and `Either` over standard functional data structures like
Linked Lists and Fingertrees, up to complex structures like ASTs or
DSLs.

### Franz Thoma

Franz Thoma is originally a physicist and works as a consultant and
software engineer at TNG Technology Consulting in Munich. While
spending time there on domain specific languages and building
compilers, he discovered his love for functional languages and
expressive type systems. With Haskell, Franz found a robust and
elegant language to express himself, which he uses for his own
personal tooling as well as a thinking tool. At TNG, he currently
works on high-throughput ingestion of real-time data for a client's
Big Data platform.
