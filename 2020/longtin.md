ImplicitCAD is a 3D modelling system used for designing objects using CSG
(Constructive Solid Geometry) in either Haskell, or in a SCAD based
language.

This talk will discuss ImplicitCAD's CSG engine, it's SCAD language design,
and provide an update on efforts to use Haskell in more 3D printing related
tasks. We will discuss the demands that implicit CSG place on a rendering
engine, as well as the advantages that the implicit CSG approach provides
when building models.

ImplicitCAD's modelling system uses implicit functions to define and
operate on objects as fields, rather than just shapes. This approach allows
for simple solutions to some common problems in programmatic 3D design, and
gives more mathematically inclined users a powerful syntax to express
themselves in.

## Julia Longtin

Julia Longtin is a long time Free Software developer, and 3D printing
enthusiast. She has been designing and building 3D printers for over a
decade, but has only been working with haskell for the last five years,
since she discovered ImplicitCAD. An Operations Engineer by trade, Julia
comes from the United States, but moved to Berlin with her wife last year.
