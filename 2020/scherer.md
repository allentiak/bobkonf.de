Much gets written on the internet about comparisons between
Object-Oriented (OO) and Functional-Programming (FP) approaches
software: which one is going to solve all your programming problems?
If we concentrate on <i>precise</i>, <i>objective</i> comparisons
and relations between the two sides, the programming-language folklore
mentions a symmetry (often called a "duality") between object-oriented
and functional-programming styles. More precisely, a symmetry between
program organizations based on class decompositions, and those based
on sum types (also called variant types or algebraic datatypes). In
this talk we propose to revisit this symmetry, discussing both
practical and theoretical aspects.

writes free software. He works at INRIA, a French public institute
for computer-science research, and is an active contributor to the
OCaml programming language specification and implementation.
