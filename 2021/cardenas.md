[*TidalCycles*](https://tidalcycles.org/) (or 'tidal' for short) is
free/open-source software, that allows you to make patterns with code,
whether live coding music at algoraves or composing in the studio.

It includes language for describing flexible (e.g. polyphonic,
polyrhythmic, generative) sequences. It also has an extensive library of
patterning functions, for transforming and combining them.

Tidal is highly composable in that pattern transformations can be easily
combined together, allowing you to quickly create complex patterns from
simple ingredients.

In this course, we will discover different techniques to create musical
patterns on the fly and will also discover the live coding community around
the world.

Composer, programmer and improviser of music, Alexandra Cárdenas has
followed a path from Western classical composition to improvisation
and live electronics. Using open source software like Super Collider
and Tidal, her work is focused on the exploration of the musicality of
code and the algorithmic behaviour of music. An important part of this
exploration consists of the practice of live coding, including
performances at the forefront of the Algorave scene. Currently she
lives in Berlin, Germany and is doing her masters in Sound Studies at
the Berlin University of the Arts. 

### Preparation

You should install TidalCycles before the tutorial.

As prerequisites, you will need

- [ghc Haskell compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)  (a Nix-based installation
  is supported)
- [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), at least version 3.7z
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (TidalCycles supports other editors, but this is what
  we'll be using in the tutorial)
  
Note that, you'll need a reasonably recent version of SuperCollider.
For Linux-based distribution, the recommendation is to compile from
source - see [instructions here](https://tidalcycles.org/Linux_installation).

From there, follow the [installation instructions
here](https://tidalcycles.org/Installation).

Get in touch if you encounter problems!
