[*TidalCycles*](https://tidalcycles.org/) (or 'tidal' for short) is
free/open-source software, that allows you to make patterns with code,
whether live coding music at algoraves or composing in the studio.

It includes language for describing flexible (e.g. polyphonic,
polyrhythmic, generative) sequences. It also has an extensive library of
patterning functions, for transforming and combining them.

Tidal is highly composable in that pattern transformations can be easily
combined together, allowing you to quickly create complex patterns from
simple ingredients.

In this course, we will discover different techniques to create musical
patterns on the fly and will also discover the live coding community around
the world.

Alexandra’s work focuses
on the algorithmic behavior of music, and the exploration of musicality
within code. She is a core member of the international algorave community
and performs worldwide using the live coding platforms SuperCollider and
TidalCycles. In 2017, she was the Chair of the International Live Coding
Conference in Morelia, Mexico.

Alexandra studied composition at the Los Andes University in Bogotá,
Colombia, and later completed a Sound Studies and Sonic Arts Master’s
Degree at Universität der Künste, Berlin. Besides her live-coded music
works, she has composed contemporary pieces for orchestra, ensembles, and
soloists, and worked with theater companies in Mexico, Belgium, and Germany.

### Preparation

You should install TidalCycles before the tutorial.

As prerequisites, you will need

- [ghc Haskell compiler](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and [cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/)  (a Nix-based installation
  is supported)
- [SuperCollider](https://supercollider.github.io/), at least version 3.7
- [Atom](https://atom.io/) (TidalCycles supports other editors, but this is what
  we'll be using in the tutorial)
  
Note that, you'll need a reasonably recent version of SuperCollider.
For Linux-based distribution, the recommendation is to compile from
source - see [instructions here](https://tidalcycles.org/Linux_installation).

From there, follow the [installation instructions
here](https://tidalcycles.org/Installation).

Get in touch if you encounter problems!
