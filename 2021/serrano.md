[Servant](https://www.servant.dev/) is a well-known library in the Haskell ecosystem to develop
REST services. [Mu](https://higherkindness.io/mu-haskell/) is much newer, and tries to fill the gap of gRPC and
GraphQL services. Both libraries have in common their use of type
level techniques to describe the structure of the services. This talk
dives into that design corner, and explores the different decisions
taken by both teams.

Alejandro Serrano is a senior engineer and trainer at 47 Degrees,
where he devotes part of his time to work on Mu. Before that, he spent half
a decade at Utrecht University, first doing a PhD about type errors in
functional language, and later as lecturer in FP-related topics. He’s also
written a couple of books: “Practical Haskell” and “The Book of Monads”.
And when the day is gone, he enjoys learning about some untyped languages
like Elixir and Common Lisp.
