## How to give a talk

### Process

- A moderator has been assigned to you, and will contact you via chat
  early during the day.
- Be in the room of your talk at least 5 minutes before the talk starts.
- The moderator will announce your talk.
- The talk video will play in the live stream.
- The moderator will collect questions via private Gather chat during your talk.
- The moderator will relay questions to you in the live Q&A session after your talk.

### Q&A session: Connect to [obs.ninja](https://obs.ninja) at the beginning of your talk

- There are two ```obs.ninja``` rooms, one for **talks #1** and one for **talks #2**.
- Join the appropriate room:
  - Go to [obs.ninja](https://obs.ninja).
  - In the top left enter the room name: ```bob_talks_1``` or ```bob_talks_2```.
  - Enter password: ```bobig_talks_1``` or ```bobig_talks_2```.
- Select **Join Room with Camera** and follow the on screen dialog.
- Please join the room at the beginning of your talk, in case there are any
  technical difficulties.
- The moderator will be also in the room during the talk video streams.
- Once in the room the moderator and speaker can see and hear each other.
- They can also talk to the room director.
- The director will tell them when the Q&A is coming up and tell them when they
  are live.
