In the typed functional programming communities, there is much talk
about "reasoning with types". But rarely is this elaborated into
something concrete. Just how can we extract tangible information from
types beyond playing mere type tetris? The secret sauce is called
parametricity, first described by John C. Reynolds, and later applied
to Haskell by Philip Wadler in his seminal paper "Theorems for free!".

This talk expects basic understanding of type variables. Everything
else – including the mathematics – will be introduced.
