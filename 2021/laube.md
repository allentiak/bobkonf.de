During my career in IT and people development I had several turning
points where I either was made to use journaling techniques or
experimented with them myself to successfully tackle the next
challenge. Over the years I reflected why those 'written
self-reflection' techniques are so powerful and – at the same time –
they are still quite rarely used in the business context.

In this workshop I will happily share my experience and my findings
backend by a scientific psychological model with you!

- You want to leverage your resources?
- You want to change habits in your life's "departments"?
- You want to harvest outstanding outcomes - at work and beyond?

YES? Then join us to get ready for ACTion and be inspired how to
leverage journaling techniques for yourself, for teams and for your
organization. We'll even use our hands, hearts and minds to directly
try out some of them!
