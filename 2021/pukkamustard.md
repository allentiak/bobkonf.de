Modern applications deal with vast amounts of data, but also with a
vast variety of data. Certain data might fit nicely into a relational
model, other is better modeled as a graph, some parts need to be
full-text searchable or require spatial indexing.

Relational databases, such as PostgreSQL, offer extensions and add-ons
to support such multi-model usage. However, at a considerable
ergonomic cost. A more unified and simple approach to interacting with
multi-model data can be found in Logic Programming. In particular,
with Datalog, a declarative logic programming language that is
well-suited as a database query language.

In this talk we would like to motivate why Datalog is so well-suited
by having a look at the semantics as well as the relationship to
Relational Algebra and sketch how complex, multi-model database can be
built on existing key-value stores. We hope to provide tools and
inspiration for experimenting with your own custom databases.
