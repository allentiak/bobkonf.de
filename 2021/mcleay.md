In this practical talk, I show how I built a public display using
Haskell, Nix, Reflex, a Raspberry Pi Zero W, an RGB matrix and a
buzzer. I discuss the event driven architecture, how to build
interfaces to C libraries, cross compiling with Nix, and some of the
difficulties I encountered.

### Tristan McLeay

Haskell in his own time for several years. He is from Australia, but
he and his wife have been living in Germany for about a year.
