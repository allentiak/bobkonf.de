           <h1>This year's conference is a little different!</h1>

<h4>How do I join the conference?</h4>
<ul><li>Tickets: get yours <a href="https://ti.to/bob/bob-2021/" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>Venue: we will meet in a space hosted on
  <a href="https://gather.town" target="_blank">gather.town</a>. Feel free to check out their walkthrough and familiarise yourself with the site.</br>
On the day of the conference, allow ~10 minutes for login, setting up your avatar, etc.</br>

<br><strong>The exact URL will be sent to the e-mail address you used to register for BOBkonf 2021</strong> at some point during the 24 hours
  before the conference starts, and also appear on this page on <strong>2021-02-26
  08:00 UTC+1</strong>. You will need to sign in with the e-mail address provided when buying your ticket.</br></br>

	   <!-- FROM 2021-02-25:
	   Please use the
e-mail-adress you used to buy your conference ticket to access [our virtual
conference
space](https://gather.town/app/rkUetgocVw39X6Mp/BOBkonf2021).)</br>-->
gather.town works best in Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox.</li></ul></p>

<h4>Where did Gather get my name?!</h4> 
<p>We are using the names provided on ticket purchase for the names in gather.
If you'd prefer a different display name, please edit your ticket accordingly
by 2021-02-24.</p>

<h4>HOW do I navigate the conference space?</h4>
<p> You will need, ideally, a
headset and webcam, and a computer with a stable internet connection (gather.town is mobile accessible,
but we are optimising for computer use).  If you'd like to explore a
little beforehand, here's gather's own <a href="https://gather.town/app/lgAy7dSoTjpXcnqy/Live%20Walkthrough" target="_blank">live
walkthrough</a>.</p>

<h4>There are too many things happening and people talking on the screen
and I'm overwhelmed.</h4>
<p>Gather has a "quiet mode" that reduces interaction distance to one
square – so only people standing directly next to you in all
directions will be able to hear you. Click on your name (in the middle
on the bottom of the page) and select "quiet mode", or press
CTRL/CMD+U for the same result. We especially recommend this setting
during talks (you will still be able to hear the video).</br>

If that won't cut it, you can log out and back in at any time.</p>


<h4>I'm still having trouble – where do I get help?</h4>
<p>Contact us via e-mail at help2021@bobkonf.de, or on twitter @bobkonf.
Within gather, you can private message anyone with [staff] in their name or come to the help desk for support.</p>
