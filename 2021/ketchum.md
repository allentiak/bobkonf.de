Darcs is one of the oldest distributed version control systems which
are currently in use, yet it remains a somewhat obscure choice. In
this talk I want to highlight why darcs is a viable choice due to its
unique, and surprisingly fresh and straightforward, approach which is
rooted in mathematics and how it differs from pretty much every other
VCS that is current being used.

Darcs' patch theory offers a unique why to work in a non-centralized
way. This can be used to structure alternative workflows, as well as
an underlying model for synchronizing data between multiple peers in
applications.

Darcs' workflow is intuitive and easy to grasp, even though the
underlying formalism is incredibly powerful. I will be presenting how
release engineering can benefit from this model and how it can reduce
cognitive and organizational overhead in project management.
