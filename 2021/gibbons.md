Jeremy Gibbons is a professor at Oxford University, where he leads the
Algebra of Programming research group.  His main research interest is
in programming methodology - that is, in better languages for writing
computer programs, and better ways of using the languages we already
have. He is particularly concerned with functional languages and with
ways of expressing and reasoning about recurring patterns in software
structure.  His book [*Algorithm Design with Haskell*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/algorithm-design-with-haskell/824BE0319E3762CE8BA5B1D91EEA3F52)
(with Richard Bird) just came out.
