Functional programming is full of "folk tricks" that seem inscrutable
to novices.  Many of them can be traced back to John Reynolds, who
showed us how to use continuation-passing style and
defunctionalization to transform a recursive interpreter for a
language into an abstract machine for programs in that language. The
same techniques explain zippers and accumulating parameters.  Buried
within all those applications there is usually a hidden appeal to the
algebraic property of associativity. In this talk, I will entice
associativity out of the shadows and into the limelight.

### Jeremy Gibbons

Jeremy Gibbons is a professor at Oxford University, where he leads the
Algebra of Programming research group.  His main research interest is
in programming methodology - that is, in better languages for writing
computer programs, and better ways of using the languages we already
have. He is particularly concerned with functional languages and with
ways of expressing and reasoning about recurring patterns in software
structure.  His book [*Algorithm Design with Haskell*](https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/algorithm-design-with-haskell/824BE0319E3762CE8BA5B1D91EEA3F52)
(with Richard Bird) just came out.
