           <h1>Welcome to BOBkonf 2021!</h1>

	   <h3>How to get started</h3>
	   <p> You're here, so you've presumably signed into gather successfully. What now?
	     <ul>
	       <li>Set up your Avatar to your liking: click on the little avatar in the bar in the bottom of the page (shows "Change Character" on mouseover). You'll see the menu in fig. 1 pop up.</br>"Character" changes the overall look + skin tone, "shirt" changes shirt- and hair colour.</li>
<li>Moving around: use <strong>asdw</strong> or <strong>arrow</strong> keyes to move around. <strong>x</strong> lets you interact with select items. Press and hold <strong>g</strong> to activate "ghost mode" and walk through & past other participants – your avatar will become translucent, and you cannot participate in conversations in ghost mode.</li>
	       <li>Optional: use your status info to share your pronouns or other info others should have about you. It will be visible to others in the Participants menu on the left (fig. 2)</li>
	     </ul>
	   
<h4>Where did Gather get my name?!</h4> 
<p>We are using the names provided on ticket purchase for the names in gather.
If you'd prefer a different display name, please edit your ticket accordingly
by 2021-02-19.</p>

<h4>There are too many things happening and people talking on the screen
and I'm overwhelmed.</h4>
<p>Gather has a "quiet mode" that reduces interaction distance to one
square – so only people standing directly next to you in all
directions will be able to hear you. Click on your name (in the middle
on the bottom of the page) and select "quiet mode", or press
CTRL/CMD+U for the same result. We especially recommend this setting
during talks (you will still be able to hear the video).</br>

If that won't cut it, you can log out and back in at any time.</p>


<h4>I'm still having trouble – where do I get help?</h4>
<p>Contact us via e-mail at help2021@bobkonf.de, or on twitter @bobkonf.
Within gather, you can private message anyone with [staff] in their name or come to the help desk for support.</p>
