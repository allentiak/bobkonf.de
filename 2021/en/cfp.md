BOB conference is a place for developers, architects and decision-makers
to explore technologies beyond the mainstream in software development,
and to find the best tools available to software developers today. Our
goal is for all participants of BOB to return home with new insights
that enable them to improve their own software development
experience.

The program features 14 talks and 8 tutorials on current topics:

The subject range includes functional programming, logic programming,
revision control, formal methods, mindfulness, event sourcing,
front-end development, and more.

BOB 2021 will take place online.  We are working towards fostering
lively exchange of exciting ideas and enable meaningful social
interactions.
