			              We welcome you.
			          </p><p>
			              We try to be inclusive, welcoming, and supportive of anyone who comes
			              to us with good faith.
			          </p>
				 				  <p>
			              We welcome people of any gender identity or expression, race,
			              ethnicity, size, nationality, sexual orientation, ability level,
			              neurotype, religion, age, elder status, family structure, culture,
			              subculture, political opinion, identity, and self-identification. We
			              welcome activists, artists, bloggers, crafters, dilettantes,
			              musicians, photographers, readers, writers, ordinary people,
			              extraordinary people, and everyone in between. You may wear a baby
			              sling, hijab, a kippah, leather, piercings, a pentacle, a rainbow, a rosary, tattoos, or something we can only dream
			              of. You may carry a guitar or knitting needles or a sketchbook. You
			              may be conservative or liberal, libertarian or socialist or have
			              political opinions outside these categories.

 <p>We want everyone at BOB to have a good time. We want you to be
				    free to express yourself and speak
				    your mind. We don't want anyone to
				    get hurt, or reminded of hurtful
				    events. And we believe that these
				    wishes aren't mutually
				    exclusive. So this one day, we ask
				    that you check your cynicism at
				    the door. Resist the temptation to
				    play devil's advocate. Let's see
				    what we can do when we actively
				    try to be kind to one another.</p>

			          <h3>Anti Harassment Policy</h3>
			          <p>
			              We are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience
			              for everyone. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants
			              in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any
			              conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating
			              these rules may be expelled from the conference without a refund at
			              the discretion of the conference organizers.
			          </p><p>
			              Any form of written, social media, or verbal communication that can be
			              offensive or harassing to any attendee, speaker or staff is not
			              allowed at BOB. Please inform a staff member if you feel a violation
			              has taken place and the conference leadership team will address the
			              situation.
			          </p><p>
			              Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender,
			              sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race,
			              religion; sexual images in public spaces; deliberate intimidation;
			              stalking; following; harassing photography or recording; sustained
			              disruption of talks or other events; inappropriate physical contact;
			              and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any
			              harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
			          </p><p>
			              Exhibitors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In
			              particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities,
			              or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use
			              sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a
			              sexualized environment.
			          </p><p>
			              If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed,
			              or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference
			              staff immediately. Conference staff can be identified by t-shirts
			              and/or special badges.
