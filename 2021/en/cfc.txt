Subject: 2nd Call for Contributions: BOB 2021 [Feb 26, Deadline Nov 13]

                         BOB Conference 2021
         "What happens when we use what's best for a change?"
                  http://bobkonf.de/2021/cfc.html
                         Berlin, February 26
                        Call for Contributions
                     Deadline: November 13, 2020

You are actively engaged in advanced software engineering methods,
implement ambitious architectures and are open to cutting-edge
innovation? Attend this conference, meet people that share your goals,
and get to know the best software tools and technologies available
today. We strive to offer a day full of new experiences and
impressions that you can use to immediately improve your daily life as
a software developer.

If you share our vision and want to contribute, submit a proposal for
a talk or tutorial!

NOTE: The conference fee will be waived for presenters. Travel
expenses will not be covered (for exceptions see "Speaker Grants").
Online or Onsite

We do know yet whether BOB will happen onsite in Berlin or as an
online event. Should BOB happen online, we will likely ask for
pre-recorded talks to make room for questions and social interactions
during the actual conference day. (Of course, we'll provide assistance
making those recordings.) Tutorials will likely happen as a
live-session.

Speaker Grants
--------------

BOB has Speaker Grants available to support speakers from groups
under-represented in technology. We specifically seek women speakers,
speakers of color, and speakers who are not be able to attend the
conference for financial reasons.

Shepherding
-----------

The program committee offers shepherding to all speakers. Shepherding
provides speakers assistance with preparing their
sessions. Specifically:

- advice on structure and presentation
- review of talk slides
- assistance with recording
- review of recording, if applicable

Topics
------

We are looking for talks about best-of-breed software technology,
e.g.:

- functional programming
- persistent data structures and databases
- event-based modelling and architecture
- types
- formal methods for correctness and robustness
- abstractions for concurrency and parallelism
- metaprogramming
- probabilistic programming
- math and programming
- controlled side effects
- beyond REST and SOAP
- effective abstractions for data analytics
- … everything really that isn’t mainstream, but you think should be.

Presenters should provide the audience with information that is
practically useful for software developers.

We're especially interested in experience reports.  Other topics are
also relevant, e.g.:

- introductory talks on technical background
- overviews of a given field
- demos and how-tos

Requirements
------------

We accept proposals for presentations of 45 minutes (40 minutes talk +
5 minutes questions), as well as 90 minute tutorials for
beginners. The language of presentation should be either English or
German.

Your proposal should include (in your presentation language of choice):

- An abstract of max. 1500 characters.
- A short bio/cv
- Contact information (including at least email address)
- A list of 3-5 concrete ideas of how your work can be applied in a developer's daily life
- additional material (websites, blogs, slides, videos of past presentations, …)
- Don't be confused: The system calls a submission event.
