        <h1>How tutorials work at BOB</h1>

        <p>
            There are two parallel tutorial tracks during BOB in two
            adjacent rooms on the upper left hand side of the Gather space.  The
            tutorials will be accompanied by a BOB staff member to help with
            technical problems and admission control.
        </p>

        <h2>Tutorials #1</h2>

        </p>

        <p>
            Tutorials #1 is the larger of the two rooms for tutorials that allow 50
            participants.  In this room, there are spotlighted seats for the
            speakers on the left hand side marked by orange circles below the
            chairs.  The persons on the spotlighted seats can be seen and heard by
            all participants in the room and screens that are shared from the
            spotlighted positions are broadcast to everybody in the room.
        </p>

        <p>
            There also is a shared whiteboard in the room that can be accessed by
            pressing <strong>x</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use a combination of screen sharing, chat, and the shared
            whiteboard to transport your content.
        </p>

        <h2>Tutorials #2</h2>
        <p>

        </p>

        <p>
            Tutorials #2 is the smaller room for tutorials that allow 20 or less
            participants.  The top part of this room is a private space, which
            means that everybody in the upper space can be seen and heard by
            everybody else in that area.  This allows for a more interactive
            experience in the smaller tutorial setting.
        </p>

        <p>
            There also is a shared whiteboard in the room that can be accessed by
            pressing <strong>x</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
            Additionally, there are private work areas in the lower half to be
            able to split out groups during the tutorial.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use a combination of screen sharing, chat, the shared
            whiteboard, and group sessions to transport your content.
