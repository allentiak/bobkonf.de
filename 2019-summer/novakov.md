Scala Type Classes are often used in different Scala libraries. Type
Classes solve problems of OOP polymorphism using elegant ideas of
parametric and ad hoc polymorphism. This leads to less coupled and
more extensible code when designing a project library or leveraging
already designed type system with type classes approach. In order to
understand Type Classes, we will shorty look at their origination
language, like Haskell, as well as similar idea of Type Classes in
Rust. We will go through the Type Class implementation in Scala and
look at future support of Type Classes in Scala 3 (Dotty).
