Conal Elliott is a Distinguished Scientist at Target.  Conal explores
elegant and principled techniques from math and programming language
theory for building fast, correct, and beautiful software, now with
applications including machine learning and other large-scale
optimization problems. Much of his current work is based on category
theory, particularly automatic translation of Haskell programs into
various categories for enhanced abilities such as automatic
differentiation and for massively parallel execution on GPUs or FPGAs.
Conal invented the paradigm now known as “functional reactive
programming” in the early 1990s, and then pioneered compilation
techniques for high-performance, high-level embedded domain-specific
languages, with applications including 2D and 3D computer graphics.
