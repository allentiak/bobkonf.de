### Cleaning the big picture
As game-app developers we want to create many games that are easy to maintain.
Creation and maintenance gets easier when we can focus on:

* a small amount of game specific differences when handling a specific game.
* the commonalities of all games when handling many or all games.

In the last two years, while creating mobile games in Haskell for Android and
iOS at Keera Studios, I have used, improved and created structures and
methodologies which help to focus on the given programming task at hand. In
fact, the most important and effective part of my daily work of creating easy
maintainable games is stepping back, 'cleaning' the code of our apps by
introducing these structures and methodologies.

In this talk, I will use interactive examples to show the effects of frequent
code *cleaning*, like:

* Simplification of the code.
* Minimization of app specific code through the use of existing and new libraries.
* Facilitation of bug hunting.
* Increase of comprehensibility, usability, reliability and persistence.
* Facilitation of participation.

By sharing these experiences, I want to provide you with techniques
that help to improve the maintainability of your work and I hopefully
can make it obvious that the short term tedious task of stepping back
and 'cleaning' code is a very powerful tool to be more effective in
the long term.

## Christina Zeller

Christina enjoys diversity in her life which makes her work as creator of
mobile games in Haskell for Android and iOS at Keera Studios a perfect match.
The start-up gives her the opportunity to be part of the complete live cycle of
the apps (e.g., game and graphics design, programming, profiling, testing,
marketing) while enjoying the freedom of working wherever and whenever she
wants---for example at the sunny Spanish beach at 8 am.

Her background in educational science, psychology and computer science, and her
experience as research and teaching assistant in the area of cognitive science
is an inspiring source for creating apps. Recently, she complements this
background with photography and volunteering at an Impact Hub.

Among her recent goals are:

* the investigation and discussion of Haskell in real world applications.
*the creation of beautiful games (in programming and player perspective).
* the education with games in a natural, positive and playful way.
* making the world a better place.
