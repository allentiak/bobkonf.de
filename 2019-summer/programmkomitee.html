			                  <p>17 years ago, Matthias Fischmann implemented his Diploma thesis at 
			                      the Max-Planck Institute für Informatics in Haskell, and has been an advocate of
			                      functional programming ever since.  Among his recent Haskell projects are a
			                      participatory platform for schools, and a platform for identity management.  He
			                      did his PhD at the Humboldt University in Berlin.  Currently, he works as a
			                      software architect at <a href="https://wire.com/" target="_blank" class="external">Wire</a>.

			                      the chair for database systems since 2008.  Before his time in Tübingen, he was a professor for database
			                      systems at the Technical Universities of Munich and Clausthal.  Prof. Grust works on design, translation,
			                      optimization, and evaluation of different database languages.  His work often toes the line between database
			                      systems and programming-language technology.  His research group develops techniques for using relational
			                      database systems as scalable runtime systems for non-relational queries and programming languages.
