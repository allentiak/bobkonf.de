<hr/>

Are you interested in technologies beyond the mainstream, that are a
pleasure to use, and effective at getting the job done?

BOB is the forum for developers, architects and builders to explore
and discover the best tools available today for building software. Our
goal is for all participants to leave the conference with new ideas to
improve development back at the ranch.

Summer BOB is a one-time-only event, in the spirit of the spectacular
[Winter BOB](https://bobkonf.de/2019/). The [International Conference
on Functional Programming](https://icfp19.sigplan.org/) is coming to
town, and Summer BOB will be right in the middle of it, on the last
day of ICFP proper, prior to all the workshops.  BOB participants will
be able to attend ICFP talks on Aug 21 and vice versa.

BOB features two tracks of seven talk each.  One research track with
invited talks, and one track by practitioners, designed to
cross-pollinate and inspire.

Topics include distributed programming, testing, linear algebra,
functional design patterns, type systems, formal methods, and
interactive development.

We are committed to diversity: We aim at exploring a wide range of
tools in a welcoming and friendly crowd of diverse people. To that
end, a number of support options for participants from groups
under-represented in tech are available.

Registration is open:
