### Why should programmers care about dependent types? 
 
Over the past decade, the Haskell compiler GHC has incorporated a number of
new type system features inspired by dependent type theory.  In this talk, I
will motivate this work and demonstrate the benefits of these features through
an extended example of a Haskell library for regular expression matching. In
the process, I will use this example to analyze what it means for a practical
programming language to be "dependently typed."
