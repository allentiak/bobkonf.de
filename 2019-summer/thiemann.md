Types are the single most widely used formal method.  Using types is a
success story that avoids millions of bugs every day.  But most uses
of types are restricted to static APIs.

This presentation introduces session types, which extend the
compile-time guarantees of types to protocols: a program that checks
against a session type cannot violate the protocol described by the
type. We demonstrate session types with an example and give an
overview over features of existing and future systems.
