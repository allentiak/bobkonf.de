## Niki Vazou

Niki Vazou is an Assistant Professor at IMDEA. I started my computer
science education in NTUA, Athens, Greece. She received her Ph.D. from
UCSD, San Diego where she developed [Liquid
Haskell](https://ucsd-progsys.github.io/liquidhaskell-blog/), as
described in her Ph.D. thesis. After that, she spent some time as a
postdoctoral fellow at the University of Maryland.

Niki's research interests include refinement types, automated program
verification, and type systems and my goal is to make theorem proving
a useful part of mainstream programming. Liquid Haskell is an
SMT-based, refinement type checker for Haskell programs that has been
used for various applications ranging from fully automatic light
verification of Haskell code, e.g., bound checking, to sophisticated
theorem proving, e.g., non-interference.
