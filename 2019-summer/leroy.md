How to prove the correctness of a program with mathematical certainty?
The principles of program proof have been known for a very long time, but
it is only recently that program provers and proof assistants became able
to verify nontrivial programs.  This talk will discuss the usability of
these tools, based on examples in Frama-C WP and in Coq, and speculate on
what is next on the road to software perfection.
