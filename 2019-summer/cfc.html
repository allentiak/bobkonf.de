					<h1>Call for Contributions</h1>
					<h4>Looking for speakers</h4>
					<p>

					story to tell about an advanced tools, technique, language or technology that you're using?
					Or a gnarly problems that these tools fail to address but should?
					</p>
					<p>Tell us about it!</p>
					<p>
					Meet people that share your goals, and get to know the
					best software tools and technologies available today.  Moreover, meet researchers 
					working on the next generation of functional-programming languages and tools.
					</p>

					If you share our vision and want to contribute, submit a proposal for a talk!
					</p>	
					<b>NOTE</b>: The conference fee will be waived for presenters.
					Travel expenses will not be
