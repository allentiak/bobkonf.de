Subject: 2nd Call for Contributions: Summer BOB 2019 [Aug 21, Berlin, deadline May 17]

		      Summer BOB Conference 2019
	 "What happens when we use what's best for a change?"
		http://bobkonf.de/2019-summer/cfc.html
			  Berlin, August 21
		      co-located with ICFP 2019
			Call for Contributions
			Deadline: May 17, 2019


You are engaged in software development or software architecture, and
have an interesting story to tell about an advanced tools, technique,
language or technology that you're using? Or a gnarly problems that
these tools fail to address but should?

Summer BOB is a one-time-only event, in the spirit of the spectacular
Winter BOB. The International Conference on Functional Programming is
coming to town, and Summer BOB will be right in the middle of it, on
the last day of ICFP proper, prior to all the workshops. Summer BOB
will feature two tracks: one from practitioners, and one from
researchers, and foster communication and cross-pollination between
these communities.

If you share our vision and want to contribute,
submit a proposal for a talk!

NOTE: The conference fee will be waived for presenters. Travel
expenses will not be covered (for exceptions see "Speaker Grants").

Topics
------

We are looking for talks about best-of-breed software technology, e.g.:

- functional programming
- persistent data structures and databases
- types
- formal methods for correctness and robustness
- abstractions for concurrency and parallelism
- metaprogramming
- probabilistic programming
- math and programming
- controlled side effects
- beyond REST and SOAP
- effective abstractions for data analytics
- … everything really that isn’t mainstream, but you think should be.

Presenters should provide the audience with information that is
practically useful for software developers.

We're especially interested in experience reports.  Other topics are
also relevant, e.g.:

- demos and how-tos
- reports on problems that cutting-edge languages and tools should address but don't
- overviews of a given field

Requirements
------------

We accept proposals for presentations of 45 minutes (40 minutes talk +
5 minutes questions), as well as 90 minute tutorials for
beginners. The language of presentation should be either English.

Your proposal should include (in your presentation language of choice):

- An abstract of max. 1500 characters.
- A short bio/cv
- Contact information (including at least email address)
- A list of 3-5 concrete ideas of how your work can be applied in a developer's daily life
- additional material (websites, blogs, slides, videos of past presentations, …)
- Don't be confused: The system calls a submission event.
