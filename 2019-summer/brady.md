During development, programs spend most of their time in an incomplete
state, and the act of programming is as much about the steps required to
achieve a complete program as it is about the end result. Accordingly,
it is helpful for language implementations and tools to support the
editing process as well as check and compile the end result. Precise
type systems can support this process by allowing a programmer to state
up front certain important properties of a program. In this talk, I'll
demonstrate this idea by showing progress on a new implementation of
[Idris](https://idris-lang.org), a functional language with dependent
types which builds in support for interactive type-driven development.
I will give examples which demonstrate how dependent types support type
directed program synthesis, and type safe concurrent programming.

## Edwin Brady

Edwin Brady is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of St
Andrews, interested in type theory, dependently typed functional
programming, compilers and domain specific languages (DSLs). He is
currently working on the implementation of DSLs for stateful,
resource-aware programming, especially for correct network protocol
design and implementation, using Idris, a dependently typed functional
programming language.
