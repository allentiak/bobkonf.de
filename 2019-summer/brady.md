## Edwin Brady

Edwin Brady is a Lecturer in Computer Science at the University of St
Andrews, interested in type theory, dependently typed functional
programming, compilers and domain specific languages (DSLs). He is
currently working on the implementation of DSLs for stateful,
resource-aware programming, especially for correct network protocol
design and implementation, using Idris, a dependently typed functional
programming language.
