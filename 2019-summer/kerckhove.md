Abstract:

Property testing has been around for two decades, and the design space is
rapidly being explored, but keeping up with these developments has not been
easy. This talk gives a thorough overview of the different libraries and
explores their tradeoffs. Libraries discussed in this talk include QuickCheck,
Hedgehog, Validity, Quickspec, Easyspec, speculate, leanspec and
smallcheck.
