			<p>18 years ago, while completing his diploma at the Max Planck institute for Computer Science,
			  Matthias Fischmann implemented his thesis in Haskell and has never looked back from functional programming since.
	                   His more recent projects in Haskell include an interactive platform for schools and a platform for identity management. 
				He received his doctorate from Berlin's Humboldt-Universität. These days, he works for
				 <a href="https://wire.com/" target="_blank">Wire</a> as a software architect.

				                    and has been chair for database systems since  2008.
						    Prior to his engagement in Tübingen, Torsten Grust was a professor for database systems with
				                    TU München and TU Clausthal. Prof. Grust's research is focussed on the design, 
				                    translation, optimization and analysis of various database languages.
				                    Much of his work falls in the liminal space between database systems and programming language technology.
				                    His department is developing technologies to transform relational database systems into scalable runtime
						    environments, even when faced with non-relational queries or programming languages.			                </p>
