Writing unit tests is pretty much standard practice these
days. Otherwise, how would you make sure that your code does what you
expect? Yet, some software is mission-critical and merely testing a
few examples – or even randomized testing – is not enough. To reach
higher levels of assurance, we need proof: mathematical, formal
proof. This session will be based on an example from industry, where
we successfully verified the core of a financial application. I will
describe the core architecture of the system and the mathematical
foundations behind the verification, including the classes of problems
that we can (or cannot) discover with this approach.
