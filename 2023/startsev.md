It is a truth universally acknowledged, that a programming language
with more than 100 users must be in want of a module
system. JavaScript, first released in 1995, resisted this natural law
until 2015 with the introduction of ES6.

Since then, Modules have become a popular authoring tool for
JavaScript Developers. However, modules as a shipping mechanism
present certain issues, and many developers continue to compile to
module-free code rather than ship native modules. This has challenged
the language committee to investigate what is and what isnâ€™t working
about our module system.

How do we do this, and how do we communicate these design changes from a
small focus group to a larger design committee? A number of proposals are
planned that change what kind of applications can be built using the module
system.

We will explore these questions and more, giving you a behind the scenes
look at designing a module system for the web.
