Misunderstandings between developers and the business are a
plague. Bad communication makes projects fail. This talk presents a
remedy (including a practical demonstration with auditorium
participation).

Domain Storytelling is a technique to transform domain knowledge into
effective business software. It brings together domain experts and
development teams to: (a) understand the domain of a software system,
(b) find microservices boundaries, and (c) talk about requirements.

We let domain experts tell us stories about their tasks. While
listening, we record the stories using an easy-to-understand
pictographic language.

The domain experts can see immediately whether we understand their
story correctly. After very few stories, we are able to talk about the
people, processes, and events in that domain.

The session is aimed at everyone involved or interested in software
development, including non-technical people.
