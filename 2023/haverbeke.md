In systems whose state consists of a non-trivial number of separate
but related pieces, updating this state in a way that keeps everything
coherent requires some discipline. In extensible systems, where the
different pieces may not even be aware of each other, this becomes
even more challenging.

A good example of such a system is a modular code editor. It involves
a number of constantly-changing pieces of state (the document,
selection, scroll position, and so on) and a lot of non-core state
intimately entangled with those (syntax highlighting, linting,
completion), and possibly with each other.

This presentation discusses the set of principles we arrived at in
designing such an editor ([CodeMirror](https://codemirror.net)), and
compares it to the more traditional event-style architectures. The
editor uses persistent state values and first-class transactions, both
of them extensible by 3rd-party code, to make it straightforward by
construction to keep the zoo of interdependent data involved in a
full-featured editor coherent.
