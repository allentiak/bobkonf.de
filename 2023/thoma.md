Factorio is a simulation game where you build a highly automated factory,
producing the technology to eventually launch a rocket to space. Along the way,
every new task will be manual at first, but you can (and will need to) automate
it.

I stumbled upon this game a few years ago, got hooked, and spent (way!) too many
hours playing it. While I was knee-deep in refactoring my base in Factorio,
making it more scalable and resilient, at some point I realized that this is
eerily similar to what I'm doing in my day job. (Probably also the cause why I'm
so seriously hooked on that game.)

So although this talk will look like it's about Factorio, it's in fact about how
to bootstrap and scale teams and projects, about monoliths and microservices,
and about the cost of maintenance.

### Franz Thoma

Franz Thoma is originally a physicist and works as a consultant and
software engineer at TNG Technology Consulting in Munich. While
spending time there on domain specific languages and building
compilers, he discovered his love for functional languages and
expressive type systems. With Haskell, Franz found a robust and
elegant language to express himself, which he uses for his own
personal tooling as well as a thinking tool. At TNG, he currently
works on high-throughput ingestion of real-time data for a client's
Big Data platform.
