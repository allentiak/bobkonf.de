We have all seen computer systems failing, sometimes in a mundane way, sometimes
in a catastrophic way. How can we reduce the probability of such failures to
happen? What makes a system fault tolerant?

In this tutorial, we will explore how Elixir answers these questions and what
makes it particularly well-suited to build highly available systems. We will
provide a quick introduction to the language and its runtime, the Erlang VM. We
will focus on Elixir's strengths but also discuss its weaknesses.

Participants will then be invited to work on a series of *tapas*. Tapas are
small projects with a challenge to be solved meant to introduce and illustrate
some fundamental aspects of Elixir and its runtime. A few written questions
complement each tapa, inviting the participants to think about the broader
context of what they just learned. Participants will be encouraged to think
primarily in terms of processes instead of objects, functions or modules.

At the end of the tutorial, participants will have a better overview of the main
concepts used when building distributed systems with Elixir: processes,
supervision of processes, nodes, message passing, generic servers, etc. They
should be able to better evaluate the relevance of Elixir for their future
projects and to adapt some of the ideas of the Elixir/Erlang ecosystem to
improve the systems they are currently developing.

Prerequisites: some experience with functional programming and Linux/Unix.
