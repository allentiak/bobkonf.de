As software eats the world, writing code that does what it promises is
becoming more and more important. In this workshop, we will learn how
to use Agda to prove properties about our software, what's productive
to prove, and show how modeling in Agda can be useful even if your day
job doesn't buy in.

### Preparation

Participants should install Agda beforehand according to 
[these instructions](https://github.com/isovector/talks/blob/master/agda/setup.md).
