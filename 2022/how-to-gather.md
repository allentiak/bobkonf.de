  2022!</h1>

	   <h3>How to get started</h3>
  
	   <p> You're here, so you've signed into gather
 successfully. What now?</p>

<h5>The basics</h5>

<ul>
<li><strong>Please plug in your headpones</strong> or mute your microphone.</li>
<li>You can <strong>search this page</strong> with the keys that activate "search
on page" in your browser – usually ctrl/cmd+f.</li>
<li><strong>Set your name</strong>. If everyone's "Guest", things will get confusing fast.</li>

<li><strong>Set up your Avatar</strong> to your liking: click on the little avatar in
 the bar in the bottom of the page (shows "Change Character" on
 mouseover). You'll see the menu in Fig. 1 pop up.<br/>"Character"
 changes the overall look + skin tone, "shirt" changes shirt- and hair
 colour.</li>

<li><strong>Moving around</strong>: use <strong>wasd</strong> or <strong>arrow</strong>
 keys to move around. <strong>x</strong> lets you interact with select
 items that light up with a yellow indicator when you are near
 them. Press and hold <strong>g</strong> to activate "ghost mode" and
 walk through & past other participants – your avatar will become
 translucent, and you cannot participate in conversations in ghost
 mode.</li>

<li><strong>Optional</strong>: use your status info to share
 information you'd like others to have about you, like company affiliation,
 languages spoken, etc. It will be visible to others
 underneath your name in the Participants menu on the left (Fig. 2,
 b)</li>

<li><strong>What about my pronouns?</strong> You can add your pronouns
in either the name field (most visible) or your status info.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Control panel</h5>
<p><img src="/images/gatheruserpanel2022.png"> <ol><li><strong>Your Avatar</strong> Click
to customise.</li> <li><strong>Your Online Status</strong></li>
<li><strong>Your Name & Status Message</strong> The Status Message
indicates your online status when otherwise unset.</li>
<li><strong>Mini Map</strong> of the room you're in.</li>
<li><strong>Share your screen</strong> with those around you.</li>
<li><strong>Emoji reactions</strong> 1-5 are fleeting, 6 stays up
until you "lower" your hand by clicking the emoji again. Raised hands
show up in the participant list.<br/> <img src="/images/gatherreactionemoji.png"></li>
</ol>
 <h5>User menu</h5>
 <p> <img
src="/images/gatherfig1-2022.png"> <ol> <li><strong>Your

<li><strong>Emoji</strong> You can set an emoji to be permanently
displayed next to your name in the participant list.</li>
<li><strong>User/Video Preferences</strong> Fiddle with these if
you're having performance issues. Also accessible via CTRL/CMD P or
Fig. 2, c.</li> <li><strong>Turn on Quiet Mode</strong> to listen to
talks in relative quiet, or reduce the overall input from the people
around you. You will only be able to interact with people within 1
tile's distance, i.e. directly next to you in 8 directions (normal
interaction distance is 5 tiles in every direction).</li>
<li><strong>Respawn</strong> brings you back to the landing
point of the room you're currently in.</li> <li><strong>Sign
Out</strong> to sign out.</li> </ol></p>

<h5>Figure 3: Special actions</h5> <p><img
src="/images/gatherfig3-2022.png" width="246" height="250"><br/> This is a
menu that pops up on right-click on a participant's name in the
participant list (Fig. 2, b).  <ul> <li><strong>Send Friend
Request</strong> What it says on the tin, doesn't seem to do much
though.</li> <li><strong>Message …</strong> Send a private
message.</li> <li><strong>Locate on map</strong> Shows a trail leading
to the person you clicked on until you undo the "locate".</li>
<li><strong>Follow</strong> Your avatar will follow the avatar of the
person you clicked on until you use your arrow or wasd keys to
move.</li><li><strong>Request to lead</strong> The person will see a pop-up: "YOUR NAME would like to lead you around the space. Would you like to follow?" with a picture of your avatar and the options to accept or decline. </li></ul></p>


<h4>There are too many things happening and people talking on the
screen and I'm overwhelmed.</h4> <p>Gather has a "quiet mode" that
reduces interaction distance to one square – so only people standing
directly next to you in all directions will be able to hear you. Click
on your name (in the middle on the bottom of the page) and select
"quiet mode", or press CTRL/CMD+U for the same result. We especially
recommend this setting during talks (you will still be able to hear
the video).<br/>

If that won't cut it, you can log out and back in at any time.</p>
