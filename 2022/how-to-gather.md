  <h1>Welcome to BOBkonf 2022!</h1>

	   <h3>How to get started</h3>
  
	   <p> You're here, so you've signed into gather successfully. What now?</p>
 <h5>The basics</h5>
	     <ul><li>You can search this page with the keys that activate "search on page" in your browser – usually ctrl/cmd+f.</li>
	       <li>Set up your Avatar to your liking: click on the little avatar in the bar in the bottom of the page (shows "Change Character" on mouseover). You'll see the menu in fig. 1 pop up.<br/>"Character" changes the overall look + skin tone, "shirt" changes shirt- and hair colour.</li>
<li>Moving around: use <strong>wasd</strong> or <strong>arrow</strong> keys to move around. <strong>x</strong> lets you interact with select items that light up with a yellow indicator when you are near them. Press and hold <strong>g</strong> to activate "ghost mode" and walk through & past other participants – your avatar will become translucent, and you cannot participate in conversations in ghost mode.</li>
	       <li>Optional: use your status info to share your pronouns or other info others should have about you. It will be visible to others underneath your name in the Participants menu on the left (fig. 2, b)</li>
	     </ul>

	    
	   <h5>Figure 1: User menu</h5>

  <ol>
	       <li><strong>FIXME Sibylle Your Name</strong> as provided on your Ticket</li>
	       <li><strong>Your status message</strong>: pronouns & other relevant info go here.</li>
	       <li><strong>Emoji</strong> You can set an emoji to be permanently displayed next to your name in the participant list. To remove, click the "x" that appears when modifying status message.</li>
	       <li><strong>User/Video Preferences</strong>: fiddle with these if you're having performance issues. Also accessible via CTRL/CMD P or Fig. 2, c.</li>
	       <li><strong>Turn on Quiet Mode</strong>: to listen to talks in relative quiet, or reduce the overall input from the people around you. You will only be able to interact with people within 1 tile's distance, i.e. directly next to you in 8 directions (normal interaction distance is 5 tiles in every direction).</li>
	       <li><strong>Reset Position</strong> brings you back to the landing point of the room you're currently in.</li>
	       <li><strong>Sign Out</strong> to sign out</li>
	       <li><strong>Your Avatar</strong>. Click to customise.</li>
	       <li><strong>Your Online Status</strong></li>
	       <li><strong>Your Name & Status Message</strong>. Status message indicates online status when otherwise unset.</li>
	       <li><strong>Mini Map</strong> of the room you're in.</li>
	       <li><strong>Share your screen</strong> with those around you.</li>
	       <li><strong>Emoji reactions</strong> 1-5 are fleeting, 6 stays up until you "lower" your hand by clicking the emoji again. Raised hands show up in the participant list.</li>

<p><img src="/images/gatherfig3.png" width="247" height="212"><br/>
  This is a menu that pops up on right-click on a participant's name in the participant list (fig. 2, b)
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Send Friend Request</strong> – what it says on the tin, doesn't seem to do much though.</li>
    <li><strong>Message …</strong> – send a private message</li>
    <li><strong>Locate on map</strong> – shows a trail leading to the person you clicked on until you undo the "locate" function.</li>
    <li><strong>Follow</strong> – your avatar will follow the avatar of the person you clicked on until you use your arrow or wasd keys to move.</li></ul></p>
    
    <h4>FIXME Sibylle Where did Gather get my name?</h4> 
<p>We are using the names provided on ticket purchase for the names in gather.</p>

<h4>There are too many things happening and people talking on the screen
and I'm overwhelmed.</h4>
<p>Gather has a "quiet mode" that reduces interaction distance to one
square – so only people standing directly next to you in all
directions will be able to hear you. Click on your name (in the middle
on the bottom of the page) and select "quiet mode", or press
CTRL/CMD+U for the same result. We especially recommend this setting
during talks (you will still be able to hear the video).<br/>

If that won't cut it, you can log out and back in at any time.</p>


<h4>I'm still having trouble – where do I get help?</h4>
<p> Within gather, the fastest way is to come to the <strong>help desk</strong> for support. If all desks are busy, private message <em>Sibylle Hasse [STAFF]</em> or <em>Michael Sperber [STAFF]</em>.
You can also contact us via e-mail at <a href="mailto:help2021@bobkonf.de">help2021@bobkonf.de</a>, or on twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/BOBKonf" target="_blank">@bobkonf</a>.</p>
