## Designing hardware out of category theory 

Digital circuits form a category. But what does that really mean? In
this talk I'll present a toy CPU I wrote in category theory. Using FP
techniques, the resulting design is type-safe by construction, and
polymorphic in its word-size and instruction-set.

Thinking about the distinction between computing on the CPU and
computing to build the CPU leads to some interesting perspectives on
software. Differentiating between arrows in the category vs arrows in
the host language has important ramifications when doing
metaprogramming.
