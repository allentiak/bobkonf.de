Derek Dreyer is a professor of computer science at the Max Planck
Institute for Software Systems (MPI-SWS) in Saarbruecken, Germany, and
recipient of the 2017 ACM SIGPLAN Robin Milner Young Researcher Award.
His research explores connections between type systems for high-level
languages and separation logics for low-level systems programming.
Most recently, he and his collaborators have led the development of
RustBelt, the first formal foundation for the Rust programming
language, and Iris, a unifying framework for higher-order separation
logic implemented in Coq.  He also spends an inappropriate amount of
time researching Scotch whisky.
