Kotlin supports functional programming much better than Java: Common
functional abstractions are finally practical enough for regular
usage.  Kotlin also avoids many of the warts and irregularities of the
Java type system, making the overall experience quite pleasant.
There's even native support for (almost!) monads.  Kotlin is not Scala
for sure, but also avoids some of Scala's complexity.  The tutorial
tells you how far you can go with FP in Kotlin, and how to avoid some
common pitfalls.

Basic FP experience is helpful for the tutorial, but specific Kotlin
experience is not required.

## Preparation

Download and install [IntelliJ IDEA](https://www.jetbrains.com/).
