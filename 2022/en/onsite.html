			          <h1>Virtual BOB 2022</h1>
			          <p>
				    Dear folks interested in BOB!
				  </p>

				  <p>
				    tl;dr: BOB 2022 will be virtual.
				    As in 2021, we'll create an immersive, inclusive social experience
				    along with a great set of talks and tutorials.
				  </p>

				  <p>We thank all folks who responded to our survey regarding
				    virtual/on-site BOB 2022.  We appreciate that many expressed safety
				    concerns, but also a desire to finally meet on-site again.</p>

				  <p>After reviewing the outlook for the coming months, we decided that
				    holding an inclusive, on-site BOB 2022 is not practical.</p>

				  <p>We had actually developed a set of safety measures that would have
				    held infection risk very low.  (Including on-site rapid tests,
				    vaccination check, FFP2/N95 masks, outdoor breaks and meals.)  Today,
				    we had an impassioned debate among staff about what to do, and how to
				    meet the conflicting wishes and desires of the BOB community.</p>

				  <p>However, given that an infection incidence of 1,000 or above on and
				    around March 11 seems likely, many people will be in isolation or
				    quarantine, and that will inevitably include BOB attendees, speakers
				    and staff.  Moreover, we expect that immigration quarantine rules will
				    prevent potential international attendees from coming to Berlin in
				    March.</p>
