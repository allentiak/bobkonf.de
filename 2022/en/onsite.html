				    Dear folks interested in BOB!
				  </p>
				  
				  <p>We want to hold BOB in-person: We did have a great virtual BOB 2021 -
				    but we'd love to see you in brickspace, and dial BOB-related social
				    interactions up to 11!</p>
				  
				  <p>This will only be possible if we can establish a high level of safety
				    regarding COVID.  We're aiming for a level comparable to "regular"
				    public life, for example using public transport.  We're aware it's not
				    certain we can achieve that level given the Omicron wave, about which
				    there's a lot we don't know yet.  (But be assured: We're closely and
				    continually monitoring the situation.)</p>
				  
				  <p>At this point in time, we can't rule out that we'll be able to hold BOB
				    in-person. That's why we're leaving that option open,
				    while also considering the option of a virtual BOB.</p>

				  <p>One thing is certain though: BOB 2022 will happen on March 11!</p>
			</div>

			<div class="col-md-6 col-sm-12 pr-md-5">
			  <p>
If BOB is to happen in-person, we will need to enact measures to reach an
acceptable level of safety.  We can't say with certainty which
measures exactly we'll enact, but they might include:
			  </p>

			  <ul>
			    <li>entry only with proof of vaccination; proof of a "booster" shot may be
			      required</li>
			    <li> checkin via the <a href="https://www.coronawarn.app/">Corona-Warn-App</a></li>
			    <li>lateral-flow test on-site before entry (or proof of test from the day of the BOB)</li>
			    <li>masks required at all times indoors</li>
			    <li>frequent and thorough airing of indoor spaces</li>
			    <li>breaks and lunch outside (we might organize a roof)</li>
			  </ul>

			  <p>
We might also have to follow additional regulations, depending on Berlin legislation at the time of the event.
However, we will evaluate safety measures independently of the then-current
regulations and consider enacting measures that are not required.
			  </p>

			  <p>
We look forward to your feedback - what conditions we should create for
you to safely enjoy BOB, and which could be particularly effective.  We've created a
<a href="https://survey.lamapoll.de/BOB-2022-in-person-virtual-survey/">survey</a>
for that purpose, where you can also leave your e-mail
address if you want to be informed of developments regarding BOB 2022.
			  </p>

<p>
We will make a final decision if BOB happens in-person or virtually
until
</p>

			  <p><b>January 17, 2022</b></p>

			  <p>We'll post on our homepage and, of course, inform on <a href="https://twitter.com/bobkonf">Twitter</a>.  We'll
  also start ticket sales on January 17.</p>
