BOB conference is a place for developers, architects, and decision-makers
to explore technologies beyond the mainstream in software development
and to find the best tools available to software developers today. Our
goal is for all participants of BOB to return home with new insights
that enable them to improve their own software development
experience.

The program features 14 talks and 8 tutorials on current topics:

The subject range includes functional programming, effects,
distributed programming, formal methods, generative art, event-driven
systems, the human brain, Haskell, Python, Scala, Lua, Clojure,
Erlang, Nix, and others.

Derek Dreyer will give the keynote talk.

Due to COVID-related risks, BOB will take place online, entirely
within a Gather Town virtual world.  We've placed special emphasis on
enabling social, casual interaction, in addition to our stellar
program.

Registration is open - early bird  student tickets are €5, regular
tickets are €10.  Early-bird discounts apply until February 18.  As
always, grants are available for members of groups underrepresented in
tech:
