                specifically seek women speakers and speakers who would not be able to
                attend the conference for financial reasons.  The goal is to make BOB
                a more diverse, useful and enjoyable event.
            </p>

            </p>
            <h3>Selection</h3>
            <p>
                Applications will be reviewed, and
