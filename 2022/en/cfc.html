					          <p>
					              You are actively engaged in advanced software engineering methods, solve ambitious
					              problem with software and are open to cutting-edge innovation? Attend this
					              conference, meet people that share your goals, and get to know the
					              best software tools and technologies available today. We strive to
					              offer a day full of new experiences and impressions that you can
					              use to immediately improve your daily life as a software developer.
					          </p><p>

					              for a talk or tutorial!
						  </p>

						  <p>
					              <b>NOTE</b>: The conference fee will be waived for presenters.
					              Travel expenses will not be

						  <h3>Online or Onsite</h3>
						  <p>We expect we'll be able to hold BOB 2022 in Berlin.
						    If that is not possible, we'll make BOB a successful online event, like BOB 2021.
                                                  Should BOB happen online, we will likely ask for pre-recorded talks
						    to make room for questions and social interactions during the actual
						    conference day.  (Of course, we'll provide assistance making those
						    recordings.)  Tutorials will likely happen as a live-session.</p>

					              Shepherding provides speakers assistance with preparing their

					              speakers from groups under-represented in technology.  We specifically
					              seek women speakers, speakers of color, and speakers who are not able to attend the
					              conference for financial reasons.
