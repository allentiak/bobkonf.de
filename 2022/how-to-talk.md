  password.

  with the screen icon (tooltip is "Create a Secondary Stream").

### Process

- A moderator has been assigned to you, and will contact you via chat
  early during the day.
- Be in the room of your talk at least 5 minutes before the talk
  starts.  The moderator will be on the stage - go up to them.
- The moderator will announce your talk.
- The talk video will play in the live stream.
- The moderator will collect questions via private Gather chat during your talk.
- The moderator will relay questions to you in the live Q&A session after your talk.

### Q&A session: Connect to [obs.ninja](https://obs.ninja) at the beginning of your talk

- There are two [`obs.ninja`](https://obs.ninja) rooms, one for **talks #1** and one for **talks #2**.
- Join the appropriate room:
  - **Talks #1**: FIXME Felix [`https://obs.ninja/?room=bob_talks_1&password=bobig_talks_1`](https://obs.ninja/?room=bob_talks_1&password=bobig_talks_1)
    (room name ```bob_talks_1```, password ```bobig_talks_1```).

  be most stable.

  technical difficulties
- If you want to show slides or share your screen, click the button with the
  screen icon in OBS Ninja.  (Tooltip is "Create a Secondary Stream".)  We
  recommand this so that you are able to show your slides in case there are
  questions that target certain slides.
- The Q&A session on the live stream will show your camera, the moderator's
  camera and your screen.
- The moderator will be also in the room during the talk video streams.
- Once in the room the moderator and speaker can see and hear each other.
- They can also talk to the room director.
- The director will tell them when the Q&A is coming up and tell them when they
  are live.
