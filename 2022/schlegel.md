It's been eight years since React revolutionized frontend
development.  The world of web development finally came into contact with
functional programming and was in love.  Unfortunately, the promise of
simple, understandable program logic has not materialized in many
complex applications.  And suddenly we're back using tricks we're here
to abandon: global mutable state, mutable data.  This talk shows that
it doesn't have to be that way.
