It has now been a decade since React revolutionized frontend GUI
programming with ideas from functional programming. After ten years,
however, the promise of simple program logic for complex apps is still
not fulfilled. State management remains an unsolved problem. In this
talk I propose that we take to functional programming again to escape
this misery. We analyze code "in its transient nature not less than
its momentary existence" so that at the end of our journey we find
lenses and stores and true lossless composability.
