The Enigma machine was an encryption device that was used by German
forces during WW2 to send secret messages. In this talk, we will
explain exactly how the encryption process works and go through an
implementation of it in Elm. We will demonstrate how to encrypt and
decrypt a message. Then we will go over the weaknesses that made it
exploitable by Alan Turing and the other fine folks in Bletchley
Park. By the end of the talk, you'll be able to point out all the
inaccuracies in "The Imitation Game".
