Conal Elliott's _Compiling to Categories_ sparked interest in novel
interpretations of Haskell programs that are accessible to a casual
user of the language. Conal also created some proofs of concept with
very compelling examples. However, many potential users were stymied
by some limitation or other in the PoCs. At Kittyhawk, we were also
attracted to the approach. Thankfully, we had the resources to commit
to it, which allowed us to extend the PoC and even the original paper
to make it work for us. And now, hopefully, it can work for you as
well. This talk will introduce the approach, our use of it as a code
generator for the flight control system of our electric aircraft, the
limitations we ran into, and our solutions to them.

Greg Pfeil gets to work on electric aircraft at Kittyhawk, despite
knowing very little about planes. Nevertheless, he helps them get
Haskell off the ground. When he's not working, you can usually find
him holding his breath underwater just off the coast of Maui.
