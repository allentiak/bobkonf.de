<h4>What do I need in order to comfortably use the conference space?</h4>
<p> You will need headphones or, ideally, a headset and webcam, and a computer with
a stable internet connection (gather.town is mobile accessible, but we
are optimising for computer use).  Please try
Gather's <a href="https://gather.town/app/lgAy7dSoTjpXcnqy/Live%20Walkthrough"
target="_blank">live walkthrough</a> before the event to familiarise
yourself with Gather's mode of operation and its various
controls.</p>

<h4>There are too many things happening and people talking on the screen and I'm overwhelmed.</h4>
<p>Gather has a "quiet mode" that reduces interaction distance to one
square – so only people standing directly next to you in all
directions will be able to hear you. Click on your name (in the middle
on the bottom of the page) and select "quiet mode", or press
CTRL/CMD+U for the same result. We especially recommend this setting
during talks (you will still be able to hear the video).<br />

If that won't cut it, you can log out and back in at any time.</p>

<h4>I tried to log in, but now all I see is a black screen.</h4>
<p>This
is a known issue; please try Gather's own troubleshooting guide that
can be found <a
href="https://support.gather.town/help/help-black-screen">here</a>.</p>
