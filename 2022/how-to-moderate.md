## How to moderate

### Early in the conference

- DM your speakers with a short greeting, informing them you're the moderator.

### 10 minutes before your session: Connect to [vdo.ninja](https://vdo.ninja)

- There are two [`vdo.ninja`](https://vdo.ninja) rooms, one for **talks #1** and one for **talks #2**.
- Join the appropriate room:
  - **Talks #1**: [`https://vdo.ninja/?room=bob_talks_1&password=bobig_talks_1`](https://vdo.ninja/?room=bob_talks_1&password=bobig_talks_1)
    (room name ```bob_talks_1```, password ```bobig_talks_1```).
  - **Talks #2**: [`https://vdo.ninja/?room=bob_talks_2&password=bobig_talks_2`](https://vdo.ninja/?room=bob_talks_2&password=bobig_talks_2)
    (room name ```bob_talks_2```, password ```bobig_talks_2```).
- Select **Join Room with Camera** and follow the on screen dialog.
- The speaker will be also in the room during the talk video streams.
- Once in the room the moderator and speaker can see and hear each other.
- They can also talk to the room director.
- The director will tell them when the Q&A is coming up and tell them when they
  are live.

### Before the talk: announce speaker and talk

- Get up on the stage so the speaker can find you.
- Prepare speaker and talk announcement.
- Use preferred pronouns.
- Ask audience to please silence their microphones when just watching the video
  and not speaking to avoid leaking audio.
- Announce that the audience can submit questions during the talk by chatting
  via Gather's private chat to you.
- Director switches to talk video scene after announcement.

### During the talk: 

- Collect questions from audience.
- Be prepared to ask a question yourself if audience has no questions.

### After the talk:
- Thank the speaker.
- Relay questions to speaker.
  - Choose most interesting questions (might be hard).
  - Choose most asked question.
  - You can relay the asker's name.
- Even talks that use up their whole slot with the talk video get one or two
  short questions.
- Keep an eye on the schedule and finish as timely as possible!
- Thank the speaker again.
- Announce what comes up next.
