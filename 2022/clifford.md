Python is well known as a dynamically typed language, but it has an
increasingly mature system of type annotations which can be gradually
introduced to an existing code base. I'd like to tell you some good
stuff, some bad stuff and some terrible stuff - based around my
experience adding type annotations to a large Python codebase over the
last few years.

Most of my professional work has been either with Haskell or with High
Performance Computing. For fun, I program a lot of LEDs. I've worked
across the world for universities and startups. My guilty secret is
that I still take a bit of money to program PHP.
