[Purescript](http://www.purescript.org/) is a language for
functional programming in the browser designed for low adoption
barriers.  It looks very much like somebody took static types and
explicit effects out of Haskell and imposed them on javascript.  And
in fact, this is how Purescript happened.

In the short 90 minutes we have, I will cover the basics of purescript
for those who are not familiar with functional programming, and then
walk you through a small web app with <a href="https://github.com/slamdata/purescript-halogen">purescript-halogen</a>,
an FRP-ish UI library.  I hope to have time to demonstrate how
purescript comfortably integrates with any existing javascript
context, which makes it a great tool for incremental adoption.

Prerequisites: You can either come completely unprepared, or, if you
want to participate more actively, install the tutorial setup provided
online (coming up).  Knowledge of purescript is not required, but a
certain aptitude in at least one other programming language will be
helpful.  Some knowledge of the JavaScript world will help you getting
the code to run in the browser.

Presentation language will be English, but I am happy to discuss your
questions in German.
