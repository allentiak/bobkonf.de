Whenever people talk about functional programming, Haskell/Clojure/Erlang
come to their mind; whenever we think about front-end development, we think
about JavaScript. Front-end development is just as important as backend, so
if we can improve on the languages we use for our frontend apps, I think we
should do it. ReactJS embraces the modularity concept, using it with
ImmutableJS is one of the ways to write our front-end apps in functional
ways. ClojureScript and PureScript are both functional languages for
front-end, and I will introduce how using them can be even more beneficial.

### Julia Gao

Julia Gao is a software developer and a CS student. She currently uses
ReactJS and ImmutableJS for work, and learns more about functional
programming along with some of the functional programming languages
such as Racket and Haskell. She likes to learn new techniques about how
to make applications better and write better code to improve ther
quality.
