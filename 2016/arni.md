Verdict is a Haskell library that provides a way of reifying
constraints on a type. It exposes a type-level DSL for constraints,
and provides functions to verify that those constraints hold of a
value, to represent those constraints as JSON schema, to deserialize
values with validation, to deal with implications between constraints,
and others. We will see how this provides us with a lightweight and
practical (at the cost of some safety and runtime checks) contract
system.
