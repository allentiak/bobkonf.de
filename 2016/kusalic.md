Type Classes are one of the most powerful abstractions we have at our
disposal. They provide abstraction capabilities in static languages
commonly held only possible in dynamic languages with duck-typing and
monkey-patching. They allows us to write algorithms that are extremely
generic and reusable.

They are used on everyday basis in languages that support them for
common operations like sorting, comparison etc. They are irreplaceable
to library authors. Understanding them pushes our understanding of
what is possible to express in software.

You probably won't need to create your own every day or maybe even
every month, but when you do need them, there is no other tool that
would get you that far.

Wikipedia defines type class as a type system construct that supports
ad hoc polymorphism. That probably doesn't tell you that much. Maybe
you've heard that Haskell has them baked in or that Scala supports
them as a design pattern. Come to the talk and learn what exactly they
are and how they could be useful to you. You'll learn about structural
types as a bonus along the way.
