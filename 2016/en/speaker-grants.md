# Speaker Grants

BOB is pleased to announce our first round of Speaker Grants to
support speakers from groups under-represented in technology.  We
specifically seek women speakers and speakers who would not be able to
attend the conference for financial reasons.  The goal is to make BOB
a more diverse, useful and enjoyable event.

### Eligibility

Speaker Grants are available for all speakers accepted at
BOB 2016 from under-represented groups in technology.

### Selection

Applications will be reviewed by a committee consisting of
Michael Sperber, Active Group and Stefan Wehr, factis Research, and
will be accepted based upon need and impact. All information will be
kept confidential by the committee.

### Grants

We currently have six Speaker Grants available that will cover
reasonable travel costs, travel assistance and accommodation for the
nights before and after BOB - i.e. from Feb 18, 2016 to Feb 20, 2016.
Note that recipients of Speaker Grants will - like all speakers -
enjoy free registration at BOB 2016.

### Application
