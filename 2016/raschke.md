This brief tutorial introduces Erlang and focuses mainly on the
features that make it stand out in the large forest of programming
languages: pattern matching, concurrency and distribution,
communication using messages, and error handling and recovery.

This tutorial covers high level concepts about Erlang but is
technical as well. Having some proficiency in at least one
programming language will be helpful, as well as some experience in
building software systems.

This tutorial does not require an Erlang development environment,
but if you'd like to experiment with the language it will be helpful
to have a working copy of Erlang installed on your laptop.

### Robby Raschke

Robby Raschke first encountered Erlang about 20 years ago in an
obscure paper entitled "Turbo Erlang: Approaching the Speed of C"
and as soon as Erlang became publicly available began his quest to
use it for real work. He has been working full time with Erlang for
the past 10 years, working in diverse areas: using Erlang to
orchestrate enterprise application integration, maintain distributed
databases, help online betting provide realtime feedback.
