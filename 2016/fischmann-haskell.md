Haskell is an elegant and fascinating language that has made purely
functional programming practical. This tutorial aims at giving you a
sense of direction in the Haskell eco system. We will explain and
motivate key language concepts and introduce tools and development
techniques as we need them for our examples.

We will start by exploring basic syntax and the Haskell type system in
an interactive Haskell environment. The need to write (slightly)
larger programs will naturally lead us to the Haskell module
system. We will show how to use cabal and the hackage library database
to install packages and create our own.

Key language concepts are hard to pick and will depend on the
interests of the audience. Some candidates are algebraic data types
and pattern matching, polymorphic functions, type classes, monads, GHC
language extensions, or programming with typed holes.

Presentation language will be English, but we are happy to discuss
your questions in German.

### Preparations

Prerequisites: You should install the [Haskell
Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/) on your laptop.
Knowledge of Haskell is not required, but a certain aptitude in at
least one other programming language will be helpful.

### Matthias Fischmann

Matthias Fischmann has implemented his thesis at the Max Planck
Institute for Computer Science in Haskell 15 years ago, and has been a
user and proponent of functional programming ever since.  He works as
a software consultant for well-typed.com and is CEO at zerobuzz.net.

### Andres Löh

Andres Löh is a Haskell consultant and co-owner of Well-Typed LLP. He is based
in Regensburg, Germany. He started using Haskell in 1997, when being an
undergraduate student of mathematics in Konstanz, and has been an enthusiastic
functional programmer ever since. Andres obtained a PhD in Computer Science
from Utrecht University in 2004, on extending the Haskell language with
capabilities for datatype-generic programming. After having been a university
lecturer for several years, he joined Well-Typed in 2010. 
 
Andres is very interested in applying functional programming to real-world
problems, and in particular in datatype-generic programming, domain-specific
languages, (dependent) type systems, parallel and concurrent programming, and
the theory of version control.
