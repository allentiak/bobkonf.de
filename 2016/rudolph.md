Akka HTTP is a modern toolkit for all things HTTP in Scala. It
features a fully asynchronous, non-blocking, and streaming
implementation of HTTP for the client and the server side. Its basis
is a typed, immutable data model of HTTP primitives like headers,
methods, status codes, and content types. The HTTP engine itself is
built on top of Akka Stream, a new library for versatile, asynchronous
stream processing. A high-level routing DSL provides a
developer-friendly API to compose your REST-API from a rich library of
predefined routing components.

In this tutorial we will walk through the basic elements of the
library and try to build a minimal server application which could
serve as a starting point for your own projects.

Some knowledge of Scala syntax would be advantageous.

### Johannes Rudolph

Johannes has been writing Scala code as a freelancer for quite a
while. For the last 3 years, he has worked on the open source Akka
HTTP library and its predecessor spray.io. In the process, he learned
to like analyzing asynchronously running systems and solving
performance issues across the whole stack.
