BOB is the forum for developers, architects and builders to explore
and discover the best tools available today for building software. Our
goal is for all participants to leave the conference with new ideas to
improve development back at the ranch.

- Professional: Top keynote speakers, two tracks of talks and two
  tutorial tracks

- Invigorating: ~160 developers, architekts, makers come to BOB every year

- Diverse: Participants from groups underrepresented in tech receive
  extensive support
