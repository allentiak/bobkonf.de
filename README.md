# BOB

This repository contains the web pages of BOB Conference.

## Test locally

There are a couple of ways to serve the website [on
localhost](http://127.0.0.1:4000), while watching for changes to the files:

### With Nix

If you have an installation of [Nix](https://nixos.org), the following will
suffice:

```shell
nix run
```

### With Jekyll

```
jekyll serve --watch --incremental
```
