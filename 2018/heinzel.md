Haskell is an elegant and fascinating language that has made functional programming practical. In this tutorial, we will discover some key concepts of Haskell in an interactive tour tailored to the interests of the audience.

Possible topics include:
- purity
- lazy evaluation
- recursion
- higher-order functions
- algebraic data types
- polymorphism
- type classes
- some common abstractions
- type driven development

Since 90 minutes are not enough to learn all details of a language, the main goal of this tutorial is to provide an overview of what makes Haskell special and serve as a starting point from which participants can continue learning on their own.

No previous knowledge about functional programming is assumed, but some experience with programming in general might be helpful.
To follow along and try their own ideas, participants will need the GHC compiler (which can be installed as part of the [Haskell Platform](https://www.haskell.org/platform/)).
Please make sure to set it up beforehand so we can start on time! You should be able to start the interactive interpreter GHCi.
