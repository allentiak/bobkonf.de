[Video](https://lang.video/) is a language for making movies. It
combines the power of a traditional video editor with the capabilities
of a full programming language. Video integrates with the Racket
ecosystem and extensions for [DrRacket](http://racket-lang.org/) to
transform it into a non-linear video editor.

Racket enables developers to create languages (as libraries) to narrow
the gap between the terminology of a problem domain and general
programming constructs.  The development of the video editing language
cleanly demonstrates how the Racket doctrine naturally leads to the
creation of language hierarchies, analogous to the hierarchies of
modules found in conventional functional languages.
