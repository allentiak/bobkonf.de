### [Alexandra Cárdenas](http://cargocollective.com/tiemposdelruido)

Composer, programmer and improviser of music, Alexandra Cárdenas has
followed a path from Western classical composition to improvisation
and live electronics. Using open source software like Super Collider
and Tidal, her work is focused on the exploration of the musicality of
code and the algorithmic behaviour of music. An important part of this
exploration consists of the practice of live coding, including
performances at the forefront of the Algorave scene. Currently she
lives in Berlin, Germany and is doing her masters in Sound Studies at
the Berlin University of the Arts. 

Samples of her work are on her [YouTube
channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCWrAIU_pkQs9Ay1-AHFyipg?view_as=subscriber).
