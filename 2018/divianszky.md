I am interested in higher-order Functional Reactive Programming
frameworks to compose interactive functional programs, especially for
writing Graphical User Interfaces. For me, Reflex and FRPNow seems to
be the best Haskell frameworks for doing this, but both of them lack
two-way connections between the components.

I demonstrate that a similar FRP framework with two-way connections
helps to write more modular programs.

I also show that one can write GUIs by defining Haskell data types and
deriving editors for them with generic programming which can be seen
as a higher-level FRP programming.

I use GHC.Generics and GHCJS.

I am going to give a tutorial with exercises for the demonstration.


## Péter Diviánszky

After graduating as a mathematician I switched to pure functional
programming. I completed my phd research in the same field, while
teaching this subject at Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest. After
working for ten years in academia I decided to try the practical
applications in industry (Standard Chartered Bank, Singapore and
Prezi, Budapest). At the moment I am self-employed.
