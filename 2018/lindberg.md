We present a new hardware platform called [GRiSP](https://www.grisp.org). It allows you to run
Erlang on bare metal hardware, without a kernel. It is specifically
made for rapid prototyping of Internet of Things devices and has a
wide range of hardware access ports. We will introduce the hardware,
talk about how Erlang runs natively on the device and give an overview
of some of the research that the platform is involved in. We are a
member of the LightKone H2020 EU project doing research on edge
computing, including for example Conflict-free Replicated Data Types
(CRDTs). The GRiSP board will be used as a prototyping edge device by
the researchers for IoT applications and by us for use cases ranging
from "industry 4.0" smart conveyor belts to smart metering. A live
demo will be showcased showing of some features of the device and how
to interact with hardware components.
