Purely functional programming languages like Haskell do not allow
mutable state or other side effects in plain functions. A popular
misconception says that this could make real-life tasks like
programming graphical user interfaces (GUI) more difficult. This is
not the case. The aim of this tutorial is to show that Haskell is, in
fact, well-suited for GUI programming.

In this tutorial, I will give a hands-on introduction to writing GUI
applications with Haskell using my GUI library "Threepenny". This
library is easy to install, because it uses the web browser as a
display. First, I will give a brief overview of the library
architecture. Then, I will present the basic concepts of GUI
programming in Haskell by walking through a few example programs. At
the end, we will look at how the paradigm of functional reactive
programming (FRP), a radical departure from the traditional imperative
paradigm, can simplify GUI programming.

## Heinrich Apfelmus

Heinrich Apfelmus has been programming in Haskell for more than 10
years, and develops several open source libraries, currently focusing
on graphical user interfaces (GUI) and functional reactive programming
(FRP). Heinrich has studied mathematics and currently works in
theoretical physics. As a student, he has participated in
international programming competitions.
