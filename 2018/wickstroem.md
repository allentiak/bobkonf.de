When modeling problem domains, we collect different possible states,
legal transitions between states, and relevant data for each
state. Finite-state machines emerge. To verify that programs are
constructed correctly, and to have a living machine-verified
documentation, we should let the compiler in on our trade secrets.

In this talk we will look at motivations and examples of encoding
finite-state machines, using the expressive type systems of Haskell
and PureScript. We will see how they help us in implementing our
model, and how they communicate a high-level design.

## Oskar Wickström

After some years of musical education, Oskar Wickström began his
journey into the world of software. He's currently doing remote work
in Haskell. Among the technical topics that interest Oskar are
functional programming, systems design, web technology, and
programming languages. His more aesthetic side, which mostly involves
music, draws him towards graphics and UI design every now and then.
