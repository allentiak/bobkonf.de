The human rights sector is increasingly complementing its more traditional
forms of research with data and computational methodologies. This has lead to
a demand for tools that activists can integrate in their daily data collection
and documentation work. This presentation will explore how choices in software
construction impact their work.

A central focus in developing software for the human rights sector lies in its
focus on adaptability and re-usability to ever changing realities of activists
on the ground. Concepts such as immutable data and pure functions are already
very beneficial. However, equipping this sector with tools that are based on
functional abstractions and techniques can have even further advantages. The
concepts and abstractions we use to build software influence the processes
people form around those tools.

## Christo

Christo started out as a system administrator but some years ago he switched
to become a software developer. The last years he was part of a team of
researchers and technologists to investigate issues around the politics of
data. Christo is currently an independent developer working with several NGO's
to document human rights and environmental abuses and to conduct data based investigations.
