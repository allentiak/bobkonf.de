The portfolio selection is an interesting problem: it can be
considered as a combinatorial optimization, a variation of the
knapsack problem, as a Mean-Variance optimization problem, or as a
neural network problem. It can be solved in a variety of ways, using
an adapted algorithm from the knapsack problem, or as weights for the
neural network.

In this talk, we explore the portfolio selection problem by thinking
of it as an adapted knapsack problem, and optimize the portfolio asset
allocation between multiple risky assets and risk-free asset process
using reinforcement learning techniques. With this approach, the
investment weights between the multiple risky assets and risk-free
asset are computed, which also solves the asset allocation problem.

Jenny is a passionate data scientist who love to get her hands dirty with data and code. Jenny studied Mathematics and Statistics at Simon Fraser University in Canada and went onto work on her Masters in Computer Science from Georgia Tech. She believes the reason data cannot be converted into actionable intelligence reflects only our lack in mathematical /statistical understanding, and not the limitation of statistics and mathematics itself. Jenny's interests are in machine learning, data mining, applied statistics, and pattern discovery.
