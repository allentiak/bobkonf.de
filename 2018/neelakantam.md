It’s 2018, the time of data-driven realtime applications. With the
applications increasingly becoming data dependent, realtime technology has
suddenly gained momentum as opposed to a steady pace through the previous
years. It is important to understand the main underlying concepts that make
an application work in realtime. This talk will walk the audience through
concepts such as data-sync, pub/sub, websockets, etc while clearly
underlining the differences between other technologies, paradigms and
protocols. This talk will be summarized with a live example of how realtime
systems truly function using deepstream.io, an open realtime server that
provides all the realtime features discussed right out of the box, thus
limiting the developer's role to use case specific implementation.
