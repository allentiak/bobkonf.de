QuickCheck is well-known as a framework for Property-Based Testing
whereby one writes tests as properties some code should respect and
use generators and shrinkers to prove or find counterexamples to those
properties. Building on those principles, quickcheck-dynamic is a new
tool to define State-Machine like models of software, generate and run
sequence of actions, and express properties of the system in terms of
high-level Dynamic Logic expressions.

This session is both an introduction to, and an experience report on,
the use of quickcheck-dynamic and more generally to the principles and
practices of Model-Based Testing. Through a few examples drawn from
real-life use of the library, I hope to convince the audience of the
relevance of these tools for the development of complex, stateful
software.
