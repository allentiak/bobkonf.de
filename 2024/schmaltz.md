This talk offers a deep dive into the creation of a custom
Domain-Specific Language (DSL) for HTTP API specifications, focusing
on achieving end-to-end type safety targeting TypeScript client
applications with Go/Rust/OCaml backends. I'll share my experiences
and choices in developing this DSL in OCaml, highlighting its design
principles and challenges encountered.

Key discussion points include the necessity of type safety across
software layers, DSL design strategies, and the detailed process of
building and integrating the DSL. I'll cover some practical challenges
and solutions in DSL development, considering aspects like type
inference, schema validation, and automatic code generation for the
backend routes and the client-side bindings.
