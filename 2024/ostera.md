Ever wondered what type-safe, massively concurrent functional
programming could look like? Join me on a journey from Erlang to OCaml
and back again.

We'll learn about [Caramel üç¨](https://github.com/leostera/caramel) ‚Äì
an experiment in bringing type-safety for the Erlang VM. Caramel was
born out of the question: why is Erlang hard to type? ‚Äì and as it
turns out, it is not! If you restrict it enough. So much so that what
you end up with is...OCaml?

On the flip side, the new algebraic effects and multicore capabilities
of OCaml 5 open the possibility of new execution models. How far could
we take them? Could we inject Erlang's famed concurrency model into
OCaml?

[Riot üå™Ô∏è](https://github.com/leostera/riot) is an actor-model runtime
for OCaml 5 that brings multi-core scheduling and lightweight
processes, communicating via message passing.

**Key Takeaways**
* Learn more about how type safety and supervision trees make for the
  ultimate reliability stack
* Understand the convergence of Erlang and OCaml
* Get started writing Type-safe actor systems in OCaml with Riot
