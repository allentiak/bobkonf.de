Granted: A good programming language is typically much more than just
the sum of its individual features. And yet, sometimes it's worth
taking a closer look: "Computation Expressions" (CEs) from F# are an
existing language element that manages to combine flexibility and
simplicity in an amazing way.

Sounds like a nice, theoretical little game? They certainly are - and
much more: A practical and much-used concept in libraries and in the
F# compiler itself. While similar ideas like the "do" notation known
from Haskell provide language support for monads, CEs go much further.
They allow to reinterpret idiomatic language constructs and give room
to control the execution and evaluation for distinct computations
themselves.

Compared to alternative concepts such as language macros or compiler
plug-ins, CEs do not create "languages within the language" which tend
to erode a common "basis of intelligibility" among participating
developers. Rather, the original, intentional character of all
language constructs from the user's point of view remains untouched.
Hence CEs are a powerful tool that lives in the sweet spot between
versatility and quick and easy adoption.

In this tutorial we will show
- how to write a CE from scratch
- what the compiler is doing behind the scenes
- how real world examples work successfully in the industry
- how much fun they can be

I'm David Schaefer, aka [dawe](https://github.com/dawedawe), living near Cologne, Germany.

I fell in love with functional programming (FP) while being exposed to
theoretical computer science during my time at the university.<br/>
After various other jobs, I am a freelancer today and part of the
G-Research Open Source team. There, I work full time on the F# open
source ecosystem. My main focus is on developer tooling.
