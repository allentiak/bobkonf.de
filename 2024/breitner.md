Lean isn’t just an interactive theorem prover, it is also a general
purpose functional programming language. In this tutorial, we will
explore both sides of Lean by first fixing a bug in a small command
line tool that filters JSON values, proving it correct, and then
modifying both the program and the proofs to use efficient arrays
instead of linked lists.

The tutorial is suitable for participants with some background in
functional programming: we'll assume a background with pattern
matching, lists, and recursion, but we won't assume any knowledge of
advanced type system features.

The tutorial will be a mix of participants individually working on
their own and all together helping the presenter. Therefore, we ask
participants to check out the repository at
[https://github.com/david-christiansen/bob24](https://github.com/david-christiansen/bob24)
and follow the “Preparing for the Tutorial” instructions before
Bobkonf.

Ever since Joachim has found beauty and elegance in Functional
Programming, he’s been working with and on functional programming
languages, in particular Haskell, where he has contributed to the
compiler, helps with the steering committee and is a co-host of the
Haskell Interlude podcast.

He’s also always been fascinated by Interactive Theorem Proving and
his academic persona used Isabelle and Coq for formalize mathematics
and verify programs.

These two interests find their natural synthesis in the Lean
programming language, and Joachim joined the Lean FRO to work on the
lean compiler itself.

Besides such serious nerdery, you’ll find Joachim dancing Swing and
Tango (in particular when traveling to conferences, so talk to him if
you want to join), paragliding and unapologetically making bad puns.


### [David Thrane Christiansen](https://davidchristiansen.dk)

David Thrane Christiansen has worked with functional programming and
dependent types in both academia and industry, with a particular
interest in metaprogramming and domain-specific languages. He is the
author of Functional Programming in Lean and, together with Daniel
P. Friedman, The Little Typer. David works full-time at the Lean FRO
on making the process of writing and maintaining documentation as easy
as possible. Before working at the Lean FRO, he was the Executive
Director of the Haskell Foundation, and he has multiple years of
industrial Haskell experience at both Deon Digital and Galois. Before
that, David contributed extensively to the first version of Idris.
