Lean isn’t just an interactive theorem prover, it is also a general
purpose functional programming language. In this tutorial, we’ll
explore that side of it, and write a small command line tool together.
We’ll approach the problem in a few variations – purely functional,
imperative-style, with no proofs or some proofs.

Ever since Joachim has found beauty and elegance in Functional
Programming, he’s been working with and on functional programming
languages, in particular Haskell, where he is contributed to the
compiler, helps with the steering committee and is a co-host of the
Haskell Interlude podcast.

He’s also always been fascinated by Interactive Theorem Proving and
his academic persona used Isabelle and Coq for formalize mathematics
and verify programs.

These two interests find their natural synthesis in the Lean
programming language, and Joachim joined the Lean FRO to work on the
lean compiler itself.

Besides such serious nerdery, you’ll find Joachim dancing Swing and
Tango (in particular when traveling to conferences, so talk to him if
you want to join), paragliding and unapologetically making bad puns.
