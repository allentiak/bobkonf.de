                     Deadline: November 17, 2023
================================================================================

You are actively engaged in advanced software engineering methods,
solve ambitious problem with software and are open to cutting-edge
innovation? Attend this conference, meet people that share your goals,
and get to know the best software tools and technologies available
today. We strive to offer a day full of new experiences and
impressions that you can use to immediately improve your daily life as
a software developer.

If you share our vision and want to contribute, submit a proposal for
a talk or tutorial!

NOTE: The conference fee will be waived for presenters. Travel
expenses will not be covered (for exceptions see "Speaker Grants").

Shepherding
-----------

The program committee offers shepherding to all speakers. Shepherding
provides speakers assistance with preparing their
sessions. Specifically:

- advice on structure and presentation
- review of talk slides

Speaker Grants
--------------

BOB has Speaker Grants available to support speakers from groups
under-represented in technology. We specifically seek women speakers,
speakers of color, and speakers who are not able to attend the
conference for financial reasons.

Topics
------

We are looking for talks about best-of-breed software technology, e.g.:

- functional programming
- persistent data structures and databases
- event-based modelling and architecture
- "fancy types" (dependent types, gradual typing, linear types, ...)
- formal methods for correctness and robustness
- abstractions for concurrency and parallelism
- metaprogramming
- probabilistic programming
- math and programming
- controlled side effects
- program synthesis
- next-generation IDEs
- effective abstractions for data analytics
- … everything really that isn’t mainstream, but you think should be
- … includeing rough ideas worth discussing.

Presenters should provide the audience with information that is
practically useful for software developers.

Challenges
----------

Furthermore, we seek contributions on successful approaches for
solving hard problems, for example:

- bias in machine-learning systems
- digital transformation in difficult settings
- accessibiltity
- systems with critical reliability requirements
- ecologically sustainable software development

We're especially interested in experience reports.
Other topics are also relevant, e.g.:

- introductory talks on technical background
- overviews of a given field
- demos and how-tos

Requirements
------------

We accept proposals for presentations of 45 minutes (40 minutes talk +
5 minutes questions), as well as 90 minute tutorials for
beginners. The language of presentation should be either English or
German.

Your proposal should include (in your presentation language of choice):

- An abstract of max. 1500 characters.
- A short bio/cv
- Contact information (including at least email address)
- A list of 3-5 concrete ideas of how your work can be applied in a developer's daily life
- additional material (websites, blogs, slides, videos of past presentations, …)

Organisation
------------

- Direct questions to konferenz at bobkonf dot de
- Proposal deadline: November 17, 2023
- Notification: December 5, 2023
