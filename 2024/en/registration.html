                BOB 2024 takes place <strong>17th March 2024 in Berlin</strong>. Participation in the
                conference requires a registration. The registration fee of BOB 2024
                depends on when you register. We also offer a student
                discount. 
                Further, we would like to support participants from groups that have been
                under-represented at BOB so far.

                    The conference fee includes snacks, drinks and a small lunch.

                    BOB 2024 also offers several tutorials which are included in the conference
                    fee. Separate registration for tutorials  will be necessary; we'll update you on the how and when asap.
                </p>
		<!--<p>Tutorial registration will be on-site this year, via registration
list on the doors of the tutorial room.  This is to avoid problems
with the no-shows we've had in previous years, where many
people couldn't attend tutorials even though slots became available.
We'll have more information available at check-in.</p>
<p>Please read up on the tutorials you're interested in beforehand â€“ most
will require you to install software to actively participate, and there
might be additional requirements or instructions available. We're working 
to get all of these up and running on the pages linked from the program.</p>-->
