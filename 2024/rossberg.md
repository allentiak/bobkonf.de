## Keynote

## [Andreas Rossberg](https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rossberg/)

Andreas Rossberg is an independent researcher and engineer. By a few
twists of fate, he became one of the designers of WebAssembly, author
of its formalisation and specification, and is champion of various
proposals for enhancements. In the old days he worked at Google on V8,
the JavaScript/Wasm virtual machine, and spent years on TC39, the
JavaScript committee. Before his time in industry he did a post-doc at
the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems. His research interests
mainly revolve around programming languages, ranging from foundational
theory, over design, to implementation. Naturally, he also is a
functional programmer.
