Lean, the proof assistant, is famous for Mathlib, an ongoing effort to
formalize vast quantities of mathematics. Nevertheless, Lean is also a
general purpose programming language – purely functional, strictly
evaluated and dependently typed. If that doesn’t excite you already,
I’ll show off its interactive development experience and a selection
of syntactic features (e.g. clever use of namespaces to allow
extensible method syntax, innovations to monadic do-notation,
anonymous lambda expressions and more, all made possible by a flexible
macro system heavily inspired by Racket's).

But wait, you might say, does theorem proving with dependent types not
require that all functions are to be total and, in particular,
terminating? How can I write real, long-running programs this way?

Don’t worry: We’ll look at the various ways you can define recursive
functions in Lean. Often Lean automatically proves that your code
terminates for you. If it doesn’t, you can help it along with small
hints or larger proofs. Alternatively, if you don’t plan to prove
anything about your functions, you can also simply opt-out of
termination checking, and write recursive functions without
restriction. While a termination checker can be a frustrating
colleague, it's also a useful colleague once you learn how to interact
with it.

Ever since Joachim has found beauty and elegance in Functional
Programming, he’s been working with and on functional programming
languages, in particular Haskell, where he is contributed to the
compiler, helps with the steering committee and is a co-host of the
Haskell Interlude podcast.

He’s also always been fascinated by Interactive Theorem Proving and
his academic persona used Isabelle and Coq for formalize mathematics
and verify programs.

These two interests find their natural synthesis in the Lean
programming language, and Joachim joined the Lean FRO to work on the
lean compiler itself.

Besides such serious nerdery, you’ll find Joachim dancing Swing and
Tango (in particular when traveling to conferences, so talk to him if
you want to join), paragliding and unapologetically making bad puns.
