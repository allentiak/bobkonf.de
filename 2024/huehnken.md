For many, event-driven communication is often considered just an
implementation detail. However, event-driven architecture has
implications that reach far beyond the realm of asynchronous
messaging. In this presentation, we will delve into many of these
implications in detail. From delivery guarantees to promise theory,
from designing event payloads to functional programming, from error
handling to strategic domain-driven design - we will embark on a
journey from seemingly minor details to the big picture.
