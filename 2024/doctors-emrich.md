Modern collaborative methods such as event storming bring experts and
development teams together. "(Functional) Domain Modeling" goes one
step further and enables collaborative work on code. This workshop
explores two possible approaches for domain modeling, while also
practicing communication with different stakeholders, from POs and
Requirement Engineers, to Domain Experts!

**Part 1**

In this part, you can try it out "hands-on". Our PO will explain the
domain and we will work out a common understanding in event-storming.

**Tentative Schedule (Part 1)**

- Intro to DDD, ES (10’)
- Problem Statement (5’)
- Event Storming 1 (40’)
- Revised Problem Statement (2’)
- Event Storming 2 (20’)
- Retro (13’)


**Parts 2 & 3**

In this part, we will model the domain. We will first do it using
TypeScript's type system and then, using Clojure's malli specification
library. In both cases, we will be able to perform invariant
enforcement already at compile time, and domain experts will be able
to give feedback directly on the code.

**Tentative Schedule (Part 2)**

- Intro to DDD, DM (10’)
- Problem Statement (5’)
- Coding 1 (40’)
- Revised Problem Statement (2’)
- Coding 2 (20’)
- Retro (13’)

**Tentative Schedule (Part 3)**

- Intro to DDD, DM (10’)
- Problem Statement (5’)
- Coding 1 (40’)
- Revised Problem Statement (2’)
- Coding 2 (20’)
- Retro + Comparative Analysis (13’)
